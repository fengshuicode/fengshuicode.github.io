When we no longer look at an organic being as a savage looks at a ship, as at something wholly beyond his comprehension; when we regard every production of nature as one which has had a history; when we contemplate every complex structure and instinct as the summing up of many contrivances, each useful to the possessor, nearly in the same way as when we look at any great mechanical invention as the summing up of the labour, the experience, the reason and even the blunders of numerous workmen; when we thus view each organic being, how far more interesting, I speak from experience, will the study of natural history become!

The problem was that the young man had already changed his profession twice and showed no signs of settling down; he knew that his father was frustrated with him. Robert considered his son’s excitement at the global voyage as evidence of his preoccupation with entertaining but wasteful pursuits. Also, Robert demanded, why on Earth was the young man being offered a “naturalist” post on this voyage when he was qualified to be a priest? The whole scheme appeared dubious. The young man’s three sisters, Susan, Caroline, and Catherine, agreed with their father, Robert, to make matters worse. With deep sadness, he declined the offer.</div>

In the letter, Robert wrote that his son’s obsession with navigating the world was a mistake but added, “If you think differently from me, I wish him to follow your advice.”
Fortunately for the young man, Jos disagreed with Robert and wholeheartedly supported the voyage. In his letter back to Robert, Jos argued that the trip would build the young man’s character, and, far from being a waste, it would do him a lot of good. Jos’s clinching argument was that the young man would be better prepared for the Church because, after all, “Natural history . . . is very suitable to a clergyman.” Robert gave his permission.</div>

这青年实属幸运，乔斯并不同意罗伯特的看法，反而全力支持这次航行。在给罗伯特的回信中，乔斯力陈此次航行将磨炼青年心志，绝非虚掷光阴，对他大有裨益。乔斯最具说服力的论点是：此行反而能让青年更好地胜任神职，毕竟"博物学......与牧师身份极为相称"。罗伯特最终应允了此事。</div>

An Overlooked Reason for the Underperformance of Fund Managers
We encountered two harsh realities in the introduction to this book: About 90 percent of fund managers cannot beat the market, and their performance has worsened over time.
Why do fund managers underperform?</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">1831年12月27日，一个阳光明媚的清晨，"小猎犬号"从普利茅斯起锚启航。查尔斯·达尔文的环球航行将带他前往巴西、阿根廷、乌拉圭、智利、秘鲁、新西兰、澳大利亚、毛里求斯、马达加斯加、南非和加拉帕戈斯群岛。这次航行将持续五年。

这段旅程将改变这个年轻人。它将改变科学。它将改变世界。

基金经理表现不佳的隐性成因
本书开篇就揭示了两个残酷现实：约90%的基金经理无法跑赢大盘，且他们的业绩正随时间推移持续恶化。

为何基金经理难以超越市场？</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">6.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Talk to a dozen insiders, and you will get a dozen different reasons for this sorry state. One oft-repeated complaint is the misalignment of incentives for the fund manager. The fund management company gets paid based on the size of the fund, not on its performance. But over the long term, many researchers have found that an increase in fund size can lead to declining performance. For example, in a study published in 2009 in the Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, an analysis of actively managed funds in the United States from 1993 to 2002 demonstrated a “significant inverse relation between fund size and fund performance.”1 Similarly, in a 1996 article in the journal Financial Services Review, the authors write, “Once large, equity funds do not outperform their peers.”2 They go on to advise investors to invest in smaller funds.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">若询问业内人士，会得到十二种不同的解释。一个反复被提及的症结在于基金经理的激励错位——基金管理公司的报酬取决于基金规模而非业绩。但大量研究表明，长期来看基金规模扩大会导致业绩下滑。例如，2009年《金融与定量分析期刊》发表的研究显示，对1993至2002年美国主动管理型基金的分析揭示了"基金规模与业绩呈显著负相关"。无独有偶，1996年《金融服务评论》的论文明确指出："规模庞大的股票基金表现并不优于同业"，作者进而建议投资者选择小型基金。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">7.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">In some ways related to the problem of misaligned incentives, another reason fund managers underperform is that funds don’t like to underperform the market. Yes, ironic, isn’t it? In their attempt not to underperform the market, funds end up underperforming! Here is how. For simplicity’s sake, let’s assume there are ten stocks in an index, each with a weight of 10 percent. If the fund invests $100 in the market, with $10 invested in each business, it has perfectly replicated the index. In such a case, its active share is said to be zero. If the fund invests in none of these stocks, its active share is 100 percent.
Thus, active share is a measure of the courage and conviction of fund managers. Those unwilling to risk their careers, but happy to compromise returns for their investors, have a low active share. The daring ones willing to stick their necks out and not mimic the index have a high active share.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">从某些方面来看，这与激励错位问题相关——基金经理表现不佳的另一个原因在于，基金不愿落后于市场表现。没错，这很讽刺，不是吗？为了不落后于市场，基金最终反而表现更差！以下是具体机制：为简化说明，假设某指数包含十只股票，每只权重均为10%。若某基金向市场投入100美元，每家企业各投10美元，则完全复制了该指数。这种情况下，其主动份额为零。若该基金完全不投资这些股票，其主动份额则为100%。

因此，主动份额是衡量基金经理勇气与信念的指标。那些不愿拿职业生涯冒险、却甘愿让投资者收益受损的经理人，主动份额往往较低；而敢于特立独行、不盲目追随指数的胆识者，则拥有较高的主动份额。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">8.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">In a 2013 Financial Analysts Journal article, the author, Antti Petajisto, calculates the active share of 1,380 mutual funds in the United States in 2009 and concludes, “The performance of closet indexers has been predictably poor.”3 He also points out that funds with a high active share add value for investors. Of the mutual funds he examined, only 44 percent had an active share of more than 80 percent.
Have you heard the saying that no one gets fired for hiring IBM? Something similar seems to be going on in the fund management industry. If a fund manager has a low active share, they are unlikely to get beaten by the market by a significant margin, and since everyone else is in the same boat, their risk of getting fired is relatively low. At least one thing fund managers have learned from herbivores in the wild is that there is safety in numbers.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">2013年《金融分析师期刊》的一篇文章中，作者安蒂·佩塔吉斯托计算了2009年美国1380只共同基金的主动份额后得出结论："隐形指数基金的业绩果然不尽如人意"。他还指出，高主动份额的基金能为投资者创造价值。在其研究的共同基金中，仅有44%的主动份额超过80%。

你听过"选择IBM永远不会被追责"的说法吗？基金行业似乎也存在类似现象。若基金经理的主动份额较低，其业绩就不太可能大幅跑输市场；既然同行都采取相同策略，他们被解雇的风险也相对较低。基金经理至少从野生食草动物身上学到了一件事：群体行动更安全。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">9.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">There are many other reasons for fund managers’ underperformance. For example, poor performance also correlates with higher portfolio turnover, owning stocks with greater liquidity, investing in growth stocks, higher expense ratios, and many other factors. You can find all these and many more reasons for the dismal performance of fund managers in numerous research articles in prestigious finance journals.
What you will not find in these articles is the crux of this chapter. I believe a crucial reason for the continued underperformance of fund managers is their focus on future rewards while ignoring the treasures of the past.
We at Nalanda pursue the profession of investing the same way evolutionary biologists do: We interpret the present in the context of history. Evolutionary biology does not make predictions as physics and chemistry do. Nor do we. Instead, our investment approach attempts to explain the present by interpreting what occurred in the past.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">基金经理表现不佳还有许多其他原因。例如，业绩疲软往往与较高的投资组合换手率、持有流动性更强的股票、投资成长股、较高的费用比率等诸多因素相关。你可以在知名金融期刊的大量研究文章中，找到所有这些以及更多关于基金经理惨淡表现的原因。

但这些文章不会提及本章的核心观点。我认为基金经理持续表现不佳的一个关键原因，在于他们只关注未来回报，却忽视了历史宝藏。

在奈兰达，我们像进化生物学家从事研究那样践行投资事业：将当下置于历史语境中解读。进化生物学不像物理或化学那样进行预测，我们亦不如此。相反，我们的投资方法试图通过解读过去发生的事件，来解释当下市场现象。</div>

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">10.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">In an essay on the theory of evolution, the late Harvard paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould wrote, “The present becomes relevant, and the past, therefore, becomes scientific, only if we can sum the small effects of present processes to produce observed results.”4 He could have been writing about the way we invest.
“How Extremely Stupid Not to Have Thought of That”
Let’s join the young Charles Darwin, who has embarked on a life-altering journey aboard the Beagle.5 Although Darwin attained fame as a zoologist and botanist, he boarded the Beagle as an enthusiastic geologist. Darwin’s first foray as a scientist was with his professor Adam Sedgwick when they tried to map the geology of Northern Wales in the summer of 1831. He concluded after this trip that “science consists in grouping facts so that the general laws or conclusions may be drawn from them.” At the end of the Beagle expedition, he had 368 pages of zoology notes compared to 1,383 pages of geology notes.6</div>

让我们跟随年轻的查尔斯·达尔文登上小猎犬号，开启这场改变命运的航程。虽然达尔文最终以动物学家和植物学家闻名于世，但登船时的他实为满腔热情的地质学者。1831年夏，达尔文与导师亚当·塞奇威克共同绘制北威尔士地质图谱，完成了科学家的首次探索。此行后他得出结论："科学在于整理事实，从而推导普遍规律。"当小猎犬号航行结束时，他的动物学笔记仅368页，地质学笔记却达1383页之巨。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">The famous geologist Charles Lyell was a great inspiration to Darwin. He took the first volume of Lyell’s book Principles of Geology with him on the Beagle. He received the second volume later in the voyage and read the third after his return home. Lyell was a strong proponent of Uniformitarianism as the core tenet of geology; Darwin would later adopt it as a guiding principle of his evolutionary theory. Uniformitarianism claims that all significant changes on Earth result from slow and steady natural processes operating over millions of years.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">著名地质学家查尔斯·莱尔对达尔文产生了重大影响。达尔文在"小猎犬号"航行时随身携带了莱尔《地质学原理》第一卷，航程中又收到第二卷，归国后研读了第三卷。莱尔是"均变论"的坚定倡导者，这一理论作为地质学核心原则，后来也被达尔文采纳为进化论的指导思想。均变论认为，地球上所有重大变化都是数百万年间缓慢持续的自然作用累积的结果。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">As a result of his interest in and exposure to geology, Darwin was preprogrammed to conceptualize very long periods unimaginable to most humans. He was the first to comprehend the importance of deep time in evolution. He wrote, “I always feel as if my books came half out of Lyell’s brain, and that I have never acknowledged it sufficiently. . . . I have always thought that great merit of Principles was that it altered the whole tone of one’s mind.”
Darwin wrote more than twenty-five books,7 and hundreds more have been written about him and his oeuvre. We can’t cover even a fraction of his genius here. In this chapter, I want to focus on only one aspect of his method, which is evident in his groundbreaking book On the Origin of Species: his focus on historical information to make deductions about ongoing evolutionary processes.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">基于对地质学的兴趣与钻研，达尔文早已具备构想超乎常人想象的漫长时期的能力。他是首位深刻理解"深时"概念在进化论中重要性的人。他曾写道："我总觉得自己的著作有一半源自莱尔的智慧，而我从未充分致谢......我一直认为《地质学原理》的伟大之处在于它彻底改变了人们的思维方式。"

达尔文一生著述超过二十五部，后世研究其生平与著作的书籍更数以百计。我们在此甚至无法触及他智慧的一隅。本章仅聚焦于他研究方法的一个侧面——这个特点在其开创性著作《物种起源》中尤为显著：即通过历史信息来推断持续进行的进化过程。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">Darwin proposed not one, not two, but three revolutionary theories in Origin: natural selection, sexual selection, and common ancestry. Let’s briefly see what these theories are and how he used history in all of them to arrive at his radical explanation of all organic life.
First, let’s discuss his best-known theory: natural selection.
In my layperson’s view, the reason Darwin’s crowning achievement—the theory of natural selection—was not discovered earlier and remained unaccepted by many stalwarts during and after his lifetime was that few understood the powerful effect of small changes accumulated over very long periods of time. But for those who understood the relevance of history, the theory was so powerful and straightforward that the famous biologist Thomas Huxley remarked, “How extremely stupid not to have thought of that.”8</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">达尔文在《物种起源》中提出了不止一个、两个，而是三个革命性理论：自然选择、性选择和共同祖先理论。让我们简要了解这些理论的内涵，以及他如何运用历史视角构建出这套颠覆性的有机生命解释体系。

首先讨论他最著名的理论——自然选择。
以门外汉的视角观之，达尔文这项巅峰成就——自然选择理论——之所以未被更早发现，且在他生前身后都遭到诸多权威人士抵制，根源在于很少有人能理解微小变化在漫长岁月中累积产生的巨大效应。但对于那些理解历史重要性的人而言，该理论如此精妙直白，以致著名生物学家托马斯·赫胥黎感叹："居然没人早些想到这个，简直愚不可及。"8</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">Natural selection requires three key ingredients.9 First, there needs to be random variation among the progeny of an organism. Note the word “random.” Variation does not seek any goal. Second, there needs to be differential fitness among these variants such that injurious variations get rejected and favorable ones are preserved. Last, the favorable traits must be heritable so that they are passed on to the next generation. Then, these three elements repeat ad infinitum over millions, even billions, of years. Resulting in a pangolin from a protozoan. In Darwin’s own words, “This preservation of favorable individual differences and variations, and the destruction of those which are injurious, I have called natural selection.”
Let’s look at giraffes to understand Darwin’s insight. They are members of the order Artiodactyla and diverged from the other members—cattle, antelope, deer, and sheep—about thirty-four million years ago.10</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">自然选择需要三个关键要素。首先，生物后代中必须存在随机变异。注意"随机"一词——变异并不追求任何目标。其次，这些变异体之间必须存在适应性差异，使有害变异被淘汰，有利变异得以保留。最后，有利特征必须具有可遗传性，才能传递给下一代。这三个要素在数百万年乃至数十亿年间无限循环，最终使原生动物进化成了穿山甲。用达尔文自己的话说："这种保存有利的个体差异与变异，淘汰有害变异的过程，我称之为自然选择。"

让我们以长颈鹿为例来理解达尔文的洞见。它们属于偶蹄目，约三千四百万年前与牛、羚羊、鹿和羊等其他成员分化。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">This long-necked creature may have had better nutrition on reaching adulthood than its herbivore competitors because it could reach taller trees to eat more succulent shoots and leaves. Better and more food could have made this giraffe healthier and more robust, helping it evade predators. Consequently, it could have mated more frequently and produced more offspring than its shorter-necked competitors. These offspring would generally have had long necks, but neck length would have varied. The longer-necked ones would be likely to have better nutrition, be subject to lower predation, and have more mates than their shorter-necked siblings. And because long necks are heritable (Darwin did not know that genes are responsible for heredity, but he knew that something was), some of the offspring of these longer-necked giraffes would also have had longer necks and continue to be more advantaged than their shorter-necked siblings and competitors, generation after generation. This arms race for long necks has gone on for millennia, and voilà, we have the current-day giraffe.</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">Darwin collated a vast range of historical clues to arrive at his theory of natural selection, and this is not the place to list all of them. So instead, let me share just a few.
Darwin was a creationist when he started his journey aboard HMS Beagle. “Whilst on board the Beagle, I was quite orthodox,” he writes in his autobiography.11 At Cambridge, Darwin had studied the books of Reverend William Paley, who had made the famous watch analogy to prove the existence of God.12 Paley’s argument ran as follows. He asserted that if someone were to find a watch with all its complex machinery lying on the ground, one would conclude that someone knowledgeable had produced it. The various parts of the watch, working in perfect unison, could not have been assembled by accident. Hence, Paley argued that since nature is infinitely more complex than a watch, we must conclude that an intelligent designer is behind the universe’s creation.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">达尔文通过梳理大量历史线索得出了自然选择理论，此处无需逐一列举。仅择其要者述之。  
登上贝格尔号之初，达尔文本是神创论者。他在自传中写道："在贝格尔舰上时，我还是个相当正统的人。"在剑桥求学期间，达尔文研读过威廉·佩利的著作——这位牧师曾以著名的钟表类比论证上帝存在。佩利的逻辑如下：若有人在地上发现一块构造精密的怀表，必会认定这是能工巧匠所制。钟表各部件协同运作如此精妙，绝非偶然拼凑而成。由此佩利推论，既然自然界比钟表复杂无数倍，我们必然得出宇宙背后存在智慧设计者的结论。

            <span class="paragraph-number">18.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">As Darwin sailed around the world observing nature, collecting specimens, and writing copious notes, he started harboring doubts. Then, in 1832, he found his first fossil remains in an Argentinian bay called Punta Alta. The fossilized thigh bone and teeth seemed to be from an extinct giant sloth.
Georges Cuvier, the founder of paleontology, showed that the earth had witnessed many extinction episodes and presented two indisputable facts.13 First, the fossil remains of the past have no living peers; second, the older the fossil, the greater the divergence from living species. However, Cuvier explained these facts by invoking God, claiming that God repopulated the earth with new species after each extinction.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">达尔文乘船环游世界，观察自然、采集标本并撰写大量笔记时，内心开始萌生疑虑。1832年，他在阿根廷一处名为蓬塔阿尔塔的海湾发现了第一具化石遗骸。那根石化的大腿骨与牙齿似乎属于某种已灭绝的巨型树懒。古生物学奠基人居维叶曾证明地球经历过多次物种灭绝，并提出两条无可辩驳的论据：其一，远古化石在现存生物中找不到对应物种；其二，化石年代越久远，与现存物种的差异就越大。但居维叶用神创论解释这些现象，声称每次大灭绝后上帝都会用新物种重新填充地球。</div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">19.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">If this were so, Darwin wondered, why would today’s sloths have a very similar bone structure to the extinct sloths of the past? If God had created them independently, why did the extinct giant sloth and the currently living sloth species appear related? He found many more fossils during the voyage, and the question continued to trouble him.
One of the core tenets of creationism is that God populated similar plants and animals in comparable climatic and physical environments. But Darwin discovered that this wasn’t so. The creatures on the tropical Galápagos Islands did not resemble the flora and fauna of the tropics elsewhere in the world. Instead, they seemed closely allied with the organisms on the mainland of South America. As he wrote in Origin, “The most striking and important fact for us is the affinity of the species which inhabit islands to those of the nearest mainland, without being actually the same.”14</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">达尔文不禁思索：若真如此，为何现今树懒的骨骼结构与远古灭绝的树懒如此相似？倘若上帝分别创造了它们，已灭绝的巨型树懒与现存树懒物种为何会显现亲缘关系？航行途中他发现了更多化石，这个疑问始终萦绕心头。

神创论的核心教义认为，上帝会在气候与自然环境相似的地区安置相似的动植物。但达尔文发现事实并非如此。加拉帕戈斯群岛热带生物群与世界上其他热带地区的动植物毫无相似之处，反而与南美大陆的生物有着密切关联。正如他在《物种起源》中所写："最引人注目且关键的事实在于，栖居岛屿的物种虽与最近大陆的物种不尽相同，却存在显著的亲缘关系。"14</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">Darwin’s ornithologist friend, John Gould, informed him in March 1837 that twenty-five of the twenty-six birds from Galápagos were endemic to the islands and found nowhere else.15 Creationism’s contention had always been that God created species individually and that all species remained unchanged following their creation.16 But then, how did one explain the diversity of the Galápagos bird species? All were similar to, but also quite different from, mainland species. Darwin reached a much different conclusion: that a species of bird from the mainland had accidentally arrived on Galápagos eons ago and had then diverged into many species occupying different niches.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">1837年3月，达尔文的鸟类学家朋友约翰·古尔德告诉他，加拉帕戈斯群岛的26种鸟类中，有25种是该群岛特有的，其他地方都没有发现。15神创论一直主张，上帝单独创造了每个物种，且所有物种自创造以来保持不变。16那么，该如何解释加拉帕戈斯群岛鸟类的多样性呢？它们都与大陆物种相似，但又存在显著差异。达尔文得出了一个截然不同的结论：一种来自大陆的鸟类在远古时期偶然抵达加拉帕戈斯群岛，随后分化成多个物种，各自占据不同的生态位。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">To me, one of the best examples of Darwin’s remarkable ability to view history in a new light is his discussion of domestic pigeons in the first chapter of Origin. He studied the pigeons closely for many years. He bought every breed he could lay his hands on and reared them himself. He also procured pigeon skins from as far away as Persia. He made friends with many well-regarded London breeders and joined two pigeon clubs. Pigeons were big business in nineteenth-century England, and they obsessed Darwin as well.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">在我看来，达尔文以全新视角审视历史的卓越能力，最精彩的例证莫过于《物种起源》首章对家鸽的探讨。他耗费多年潜心研究鸽子，搜罗所能获得的每个品种亲自饲养，甚至从遥远的波斯获取鸽皮标本。他与伦敦众多知名育种家结交，并加入两家鸽类俱乐部。在十九世纪的英国，鸽子养殖是门大生意，而达尔文也为之深深着迷。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">22.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Over six pages of Origin, Darwin outlines the distinctiveness of various breeds. He starts, “Compare the English carrier and the short-faced tumbler, and see the wonderful difference in their beaks, entailing corresponding differences in their skulls.” Next, he described various breeds’ diversity of beaks, sizes, shapes, colors, and flight patterns. Like most naturalists of the era, he believed that all these varieties had descended from an ancestral rock pigeon (Columba livia). In Origin, he also provides ample evidence for this belief.
His friend Professor Lepsius had informed Darwin that humans had been domesticating pigeons for thousands of years—there were records of pigeons in the fifth Egyptian dynasty in 3000 BCE. Pigeons also had high prestige and monetary value in the time of the Romans and Mughals in India. It was evident that humans had altered pigeons over many years to suit their unique tastes. He called this phenomenon “artificial selection.”</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">在《物种起源》长达六页的论述中，达尔文详述了各类鸽种的显著差异。他开篇写道："只需对比英国信鸽与短面翻飞鸽，就能观察到它们喙部的惊人差异，这种差异必然导致头骨结构的相应变化。"随后他描述了不同品种在喙型、体型、羽色及飞行姿态上的多样性。与当时多数博物学家观点一致，达尔文认为这些变种都源自共同的祖先——原鸽（Columba livia），并在著作中为此观点提供了充分佐证。

其友人莱普修斯教授曾告知达尔文：人类驯养鸽子的历史长达数千年——早在公元前3000年埃及第五王朝时期就有相关记载。鸽子在古罗马时期和印度莫卧儿王朝时期更兼具崇高地位与经济价值。显然，人类根据自身审美偏好对鸽子进行了长期改造。达尔文将这种现象称为"人工选择"。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">23.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">And then he took the bold leap that no one else had taken before him. He asserted, “Slow though the process of selection may be if a feeble man can do much by his powers of artificial selection, I can see no limit to the amount of change, to the infinite beauty and infinite complexity of the coadaptations between all organic beings, one with another and with their physical conditions of life, which may be affected in the long course of time by nature’s power of selection.”17
If humans could alter pigeons drastically, given the immensely long time at its disposal, why couldn’t nature vary organic beings to create the diversity we see today? It may seem blindingly obvious to us, but no naturalist had connected the artificially created variety of breeds of pigeons, dogs, or plants to the ubiquitous natural heterogeneity of the natural world.
The Puzzle of the Peacock’s Tail
Darwin’s second bold conjecture in Origin was sexual selection.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">随后，他迈出了前人未曾涉足的大胆一步。他断言："尽管选择的过程可能缓慢，但如果一个能力有限的人类都能通过人工选择实现诸多改变，那么在自然选择力量的长期作用下，有机生物之间以及它们与生存环境之间相互适应的无限美感与无限复杂性所能产生的变化程度，我看不出有任何界限。"17

既然人类能在短期内彻底改变鸽子形态，那么拥有漫长时光的自然界，为何不能通过改变有机生物来创造今日所见的多样性？这个观点如今看来不言自明，但在当时，没有博物学家能将人工培育的鸽子、犬类或植物的品种变异，与自然界普遍存在的多样性联系起来。

孔雀尾羽之谜
达尔文在《物种起源》中提出的第二个大胆假说，便是性选择理论。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">24.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">“The sight of a feather in a peacock’s tail, whenever I gaze at it, makes me sick,” Darwin wrote.18 He felt that a male ornament like the resplendent peacock’s tail contradicted the theory of natural selection because it was a handicap to the peacock’s survival. Why would a peacock evolve to endanger its chances of a long life? Darwin concluded that the currency of natural selection is not just survival but reproduction.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">"每当我凝视孔雀尾羽上的眼状斑纹时，总会感到不适，"达尔文写道。他认为雄性孔雀绚丽的尾羽这类装饰性特征与自然选择理论相矛盾，因为这对孔雀的生存不利。为何孔雀会进化出危及自身寿命的特征？达尔文最终得出结论：自然选择的衡量标准不仅是生存，更在于繁衍。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">25.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Any character trait that allows an animal to produce more offspring is a winner in the long run because those offspring, in turn, are able to produce more of themselves. A peacock with a showier tail will attract more peahens to sire more offspring over his lifetime. Consequently, there would be a race for even more elaborate tails. In Origin he writes, “This form of selection depends, not on a struggle for existence in relation to other organic beings or to external conditions, but on a struggle between the individuals of one sex, generally the males, for the possession of the other sex.” Male peacocks struggle with each other through the beauty of their tails. The struggle is not for existence but sexual partners.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">任何能让动物繁衍更多后代的特质终将成为赢家，因为这些后代又能继续繁衍更多后代。一只尾羽更艳丽的孔雀能吸引更多雌孔雀，从而在一生中孕育更多后代。于是，雄孔雀之间便会展开一场尾羽华美度的竞赛。达尔文在《物种起源》中写道："这种选择形式不取决于与其他生物或外界环境的生存斗争，而取决于同一性别个体（通常是雄性）为占有异性而展开的斗争。"雄孔雀通过尾羽的华美程度相互竞争，这场斗争无关生存，只为争夺配偶。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">26.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Darwin also shocked his Victorian-era readers by giving agency to the females, contending, “I can see no good reason to doubt that female birds, by selecting, during thousands of generations, the most melodious or beautiful males, according to their standard of beauty, might produce a marked effect.” He was claiming that the beauty of the peacock’s tail was under the control of the peahens. It was the peahens who arbitrarily decided the aesthetics of a tail.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">达尔文还震惊了维多利亚时代的读者——他赋予雌性动物主观能动性，并坚称："根据雌鸟的审美标准，历经数千代选择歌声最悦耳或外表最美丽的雄鸟，我找不到任何理由怀疑这会产生显著效果。"他宣称孔雀尾羽的华美完全由雌孔雀掌控，是雌孔雀单方面决定了尾羽的审美标准。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">27.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Sexual selection is not limited to birds, of course. Like generations of naturalists before him, Darwin observed male stags, cocks, beetles, and predatory species fight aggressively over females. “A hornless stag or spurless cock would have a poor chance of leaving numerous offspring,” he rightly pointed out. He compared male appendages like a lion’s mane or the hooked jaw of a salmon to a sword or spear. A stag with unwieldy horns may be easier fodder for a lion but would end up fathering many more offspring than a stag with unimpressive horns.
Just as with natural selection, Darwin formulated his theory of sexual selection by examining well-established facts in a new light.
We Are One
Darwin’s third assertion of common ancestry in Origin was his most significant intellectual leap in my layperson’s view.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">当然，性选择不仅限于鸟类。与历代博物学家一样，达尔文观察到雄鹿、公鸡、甲虫和掠食性物种会为争夺雌性激烈斗争。"无角的雄鹿或没有距的公鸡很难留下大量后代，"他精辟地指出。他将雄狮的鬃毛、鲑鱼的钩状颌等雄性特征比作刀剑长矛。虽然笨重鹿角可能使雄鹿更容易成为狮子的猎物，但与鹿角平平的同类相比，它们最终繁衍的后代数量要多得多。

正如自然选择理论那样，达尔文通过全新视角审视既定事实，从而构建了性选择理论。

生命共同体
在我看来，《物种起源》中关于共同祖先的第三个论断，是达尔文最具突破性的思想飞跃。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">28.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">In his words, “I believe that animals have descended from at most only four or five progenitors, and plants from an equal or lesser number. Analogy would lead me one step further, namely to the belief that all animals and plants have descended from some prototype.” Many Victorians did not even accept that Black and White humans descended from a common stock, and here was Darwin claiming unity across disparate species.
Chapter 14 of Origin presents copious evidence to bolster his claim that most species have evolved from very few common ancestors. He called this phenomenon “descent with modification.” He starts by pointing out the obvious: Organic beings are nested within groups.19 The hierarchy levels, in ascending order, are as follows: species, genus, family, order, class, phylum, and kingdom.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">他这样写道："我认为动物至多仅由四五个祖先演化而来，植物则源自相当或更少的祖先。类推法会让我更进一步——即相信所有动植物都源自某个原始类型。"当时许多维多利亚时代的人甚至不承认黑人与白人有共同祖先，而达尔文竟宣称不同物种间存在同源性。

《物种起源》第十四章列举了大量证据，支持"多数物种由极少数共同祖先进化而来"的主张。他将这种现象称为"带有变异的传衍"。开篇他便指出一个显而易见的事实：有机生物存在层级嵌套关系。这种层级结构自下而上依次为：种、属、科、目、纲、门、界。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">Thus, dogs are the species Canis familiaris and belong to the genus Canis. When grouped with wolves and jackals, they belong to the family Canidae. When Canidae is grouped with other families like Felidae (cats), Ursidae (bears), Mustelidae (weasels), and many others, we get to the order Carnivora. Carnivora brackets along Cetacea (whales and dolphins), Perissodactyla (horses, tapirs), Sirenia (dugongs), Lagomorpha (rabbits), and others to form the class Mammalia. Mammalia, Amphibia, and other classes merge to form the phylum Chordata. Chordates, mollusks, nematodes, and numerous other phyla cluster to create the kingdom Animalia.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">因此，狗属于犬科动物中的家犬种（Canis familiaris），归类于犬属（Canis）。当与狼和豺共同归类时，它们同属犬科（Canidae）。若将犬科与猫科（Felidae，如猫）、熊科（Ursidae，如熊）、鼬科（Mustelidae，如鼬）等科合并，则构成食肉目（Carnivora）。食肉目与鲸目（Cetacea，如鲸和海豚）、奇蹄目（Perissodactyla，如马和貘）、海牛目（Sirenia，如儒艮）、兔形目（Lagomorpha，如兔）等共同组成哺乳纲（Mammalia）。哺乳纲、两栖纲（Amphibia）等纲合并形成脊索动物门（Chordata）。脊索动物、软体动物、线虫动物等众多门类最终汇聚为动物界（Animalia）。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">Carolus Linnaeus, the Swedish botanist, laid the groundwork for this classification system in 1735 in Systema Naturae (The System of Nature).20 Naturalists had made mutually exclusive divisions before Linnaeus; his genius was to see all of life as a nested hierarchy. Linnaeus was a highly devout man and believed that nature’s hierarchical system resulted from God’s plan. Amazingly, the modern organization of the living world follows Linnaeus’s system with only a few modifications.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">瑞典植物学家卡尔·林奈于1735年在《自然系统》中为这一分类体系奠定了基础。在林奈之前，自然学者们曾提出过彼此独立的分类法；而他的天才之处在于将整个生命界视为嵌套式的层级结构。这位极度虔诚的学者认为，自然的等级体系源自上帝的设计。令人惊叹的是，现代生物界的分类体系仅稍作调整，仍沿袭着林奈的基本框架。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">31.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">As you can see, there seems to be a particular natural order to this system; dogs appear rightly classified along with jackals; Canidae and Felidae are at the same level of family; and how else does one group horses and dugongs except under the class of mammals? But, as Darwin writes in chapter 14 of Origin, “Some deeper bond is included in our classifications than mere resemblance. I believe that this is the case, and that community of descent—the one known cause of close similarity in organic beings—is the bond, which though observed by various degrees of modification, is partially revealed to us by our classifications.”
Darwin was making a strikingly original argument. The classification system seems right to us because it reflects the path of evolution of all living beings on Earth. Linnaeus demonstrated that all organic life is connected. He credited God for this natural order; Darwin concluded that it could be so only if all organisms had one or just a few common ancestors.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">如你所见，这个分类体系似乎遵循着某种特定的自然秩序：狗与豺被正确地归为同类；犬科与猫科处于同等的科级分类；而除了哺乳纲之外，还有什么更合适的方式能将马与儒艮归为一类呢？但正如达尔文在《物种起源》第十四章中所写："我们的分类法背后隐藏着比单纯相似性更深刻的联系。我确信这种联系确实存在——生物间高度相似的唯一已知成因，即共同的血缘关系，正是这种纽带。尽管会因不同程度的变异而模糊，但我们的分类系统仍部分揭示了这一点。"

达尔文提出了一个极具独创性的观点：我们之所以认为分类体系合理，是因为它映射了地球所有生命演化的路径。林奈证明了有机生命彼此关联，并将这种自然秩序归功于上帝；而达尔文则得出结论——唯有当所有生物都源自一个或少数共同祖先时，这种秩序才可能成立。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">Darwin provides two additional pieces of proof of common ancestry. First, the early-stage embryos of seemingly unrelated groups like mammals, birds, and reptiles resemble one another so closely that it is hard to distinguish between them. I guarantee that the similarities in figure 5.1 will floor you. It is almost impossible to distinguish the five species in the figure when they are in the early embryonic stage. In a later stage of development, a salamander resembles a fish, and a human looks like a turtle. Why should this be so? “Thus, community in embryonic structure reveals community of descent,” Darwin writes.
5.1 The stages of development of five species. Is there a difference among the early embryos of a fish, a turtle, and a human?

            <div class="text-block simplified-text">达尔文提供了证明共同祖先的另外两项证据。首先，哺乳动物、鸟类和爬行动物等看似无关物种的早期胚胎形态极为相似，几乎难以区分。我可以保证，图5.1展示的相似性定会让你震惊——这五种生物在胚胎早期阶段几乎无法辨别。在稍晚的发育阶段，蝾螈形似鱼类，而人类胚胎则酷似龟类。为何如此？达尔文写道："胚胎结构的相似性揭示了起源的共同性。"

            <div class="text-block original-text">Second, he offers rudimentary organs as evidence of the kinship of ancestral and living forms. By “rudimentary organs,” Darwin meant vestigial organs that persist in an organism but have lost their function. He offered many examples: mammaries in male mammals, fused and useless wings in beetles, gills in the land-dwelling tadpoles of the common salamander, teeth in the upper jaw of calves that never cut through the gums, and rudiments of hind limbs and a pelvis in boa constrictors. Darwin opined that formerly functional parts might become vestigial if they aren’t used. Ergo, vestigial body parts establish a direct line between organisms and a distant common ancestor. A tadpole that breathes on land but has useless gills should have a common ancestor with waterborne animals. The hidden hind limbs in a boa constrictor unite it ancestrally with animals that have legs; fused wings in beetles show that it has descended from an ancestor that gave rise to insects with wings, and so on.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">其次，他提出退化器官作为远古生物与现代生物存在亲缘关系的证据。达尔文所称的"退化器官"，是指生物体内保留但已丧失功能的残余器官。他列举了大量实例：雄性哺乳动物的乳腺、甲虫中粘连无用的鞘翅、陆栖蝾螈幼体中的鳃、牛犊上颌未穿透牙龈的牙齿，以及蟒蛇体内残留的后肢与骨盆痕迹。达尔文认为，长期闲置的功能器官可能逐渐退化。因此，退化器官的存在证明了生物与远古共同祖先的直接关联——能在陆地呼吸却保留无用鳃部的蝾螈幼体，必然与水生动物存在共同祖先；蟒蛇体内隐匿的后肢痕迹，昭示其与有足动物的亲缘关系；甲虫退化的鞘翅则表明其祖先曾演化出有翅昆虫，以此类推。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">Darwin was right, of course. Scientists have concluded that our last universal common ancestor (LUCA) arose somewhere between 3.5 and 4 billion years ago.21 LUCA then gave rise to the six significant kingdoms of life: animals, plants, fungi, protists, eubacteria, and archaea. Although Darwin wasn’t aware of four of these six kingdoms, I find it staggering that he still arrived at the correct conclusion. What a genius.
Investing as a Historical Discipline
The investment profession invites soothsayers of all kinds. Some are shady, but most are well-meaning professionals who expend enormous energy pontificating over the future. We aren’t one of them.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">达尔文当然是正确的。科学家们已得出结论，我们最后的共同祖先（LUCA）出现于约35至40亿年前。LUCA随后演化出生命六大界：动物、植物、真菌、原生生物、真细菌和古菌。尽管达尔文当时并不知道其中四界的存在，但他仍能得出正确结论，这令我深感震撼。真乃天才也。

            <div class="text-block original-text">I want to clarify an important point before we march ahead. Darwin and his theories are incomparable. In my view, no scientist comes close to him in greatness; maybe only Einstein, but probably not even him. When I compare Darwin’s scientific process to what we do, I do it with full knowledge that it is markedly worse than comparing a gargantuan apple with a tiny orange. In the broad scheme of things, I think we financial investors are irrelevant to this world. Darwin wasn’t.
Back to the lessons from Darwin. Like Darwin:
• We interpret the present only in the context of history.
• We see the same set of historical facts as everyone else.
• We have no interest in forecasting the future.
We study the history of a business to understand its financials, assess its strategies, gauge its competitive position, and finally assign value to it. So let’s take them one by one.
Understanding the Financials of a Business</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">在继续前行之前，我想阐明一个重要观点。达尔文及其理论是无与伦比的。在我看来，没有哪位科学家的伟大能与他比肩；或许只有爱因斯坦接近，但恐怕连他也难以企及。当我将达尔文的科学探索与我们的工作相比较时，我完全清楚这无异于拿硕大的苹果与微小的橙子作对比。从宏观角度来看，我认为我们金融投资者对这个世界无足轻重，而达尔文则不然。

回到达尔文的启示。我们与达尔文相似之处在于：
• 我们仅以历史为镜来解读当下；
• 我们所见的历史事实与他人无异；
• 我们对预测未来毫无兴趣。

我们研究企业历史，旨在理解其财务状况、评估其战略部署、衡量其竞争地位，最终为其估值。让我们逐一探讨这些要点。

            <div class="text-block original-text">Those of you in the financial industry must have seen analyst reports. However, if you aren’t a finance professional or haven’t seen an analyst report before, here is a brief description. The brokerage firms (like JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs) employ research analysts who, as the name suggests, perform detailed research on publicly listed businesses and publish reports for their clients, the investors. A typical analyst report describes a company’s business and financials, expresses its overall strategy and direction, and recommends that the clients buy, hold, or sell the business. Depending on the brokerage, the analysts use a wide variety of phrases—“underperform,” “overweight,” “accumulate,” “neutral,” and other esoteric terms—to make their recommendations. Still, their recommendations essentially fall into the buy, hold, or sell category.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">金融从业者想必都见过分析师报告。若您并非金融专业人士或从未接触过此类报告，这里简要说明：投行机构（如摩根大通、摩根士丹利和高盛）雇佣研究分析师，顾名思义，他们的职责是对上市公司进行深度研究，并为客户（投资者）撰写研究报告。典型的分析师报告会描述企业业务与财务状况，阐释整体战略方向，并向客户给出买入、持有或卖出的建议。不同投行使用的术语各异——"跑输大盘"、"增持"、"累积"、"中性"等专业表述层出不穷——但核心建议终归不脱离买入、持有或卖出这三大类别。</div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">37.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Along with business commentary, most analyst reports typically carry the profit-and-loss account and the balance sheet of the latest fiscal year and financial projections for the next two to five years. In many of these reports, you will not find the financials of the past two to three years, let alone the last five to ten years. If you are keen to know the company’s revenue growth over the past five years, the long-term historical trend of margins, or how ROCE and free cash flow have fluctuated over a decade, you are on your own.
As I write this, I have in my hand analyst reports from five brokerages for Tata Consultancy Services, India’s largest technology services business with a market value of about $150 billion. They all have financial projections for the next two to three years and actual financials for the past year. Only one provides three-year historical financials. None has a five-to-ten-year financial history.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">除商业评论外，大多数分析师报告通常包含最近财年的损益表、资产负债表，以及未来两到五年的财务预测。这类报告中，你往往找不到过去两到三年的财务数据，更不用说五到十年的历史记录了。若你想了解公司过去五年的营收增长、利润率的长期历史趋势，或是十年间资本回报率与自由现金流的波动情况，只能自行查找资料。

此刻我手边有五家券商针对塔塔咨询服务公司的分析报告——这家印度最大的科技服务企业市值约1500亿美元。所有报告都包含未来两到三年的财务预测及上一年的实际财务数据，但仅有一份提供了三年历史财务信息，没有任何报告涵盖五到十年的财务历史。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">An actual incident will illuminate the reason for this state of affairs. Three of us were visiting one of our portfolio companies a few years ago. We met with the CEO and CFO for about an hour or so. As we were about to depart, the CFO received a call on his mobile phone, got visibly upset at the caller, and exclaimed, “I can’t say anything; the results will be out after a few weeks.” It turns out that the caller was a well-known investor who was checking to see how the quarter was progressing on the revenue and profit front.
If investors hound the company management for following quarter results, wouldn’t they do the same with research analysts? So why should the analysts bother with longer-term history? Analysts produce forecasts because their clients demand they produce forecasts. I am sure many of them know it is a futile exercise. Here is why.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">一个真实事件能说明这种情况的成因。几年前，我们三人拜访一家投资组合公司，与首席执行官和财务总监会谈约一小时。临别时，财务总监接到一通手机来电，明显对来电者感到不悦，突然提高音量说："我无可奉告，财报几周后才会发布。"后来得知来电者是位知名投资人，正打探本季度营收与利润进展。

既然投资人会为下季度业绩纠缠公司管理层，又岂会放过研究分析师？既然如此，分析师何必费心研究长期历史数据？他们之所以制作预测报告，纯粹是应客户要求。我确信其中许多人都明白这是徒劳——原因如下。</div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">39.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Let’s say I need to project the following year’s financials. I will need to forecast at least ten (if not more) numbers ranging from units sold, price per unit, cost of goods sold, sales expenses, receivables, capital expenditure, and so on. Let’s assume that I am a great guesser and that I will correctly guess each of the ten numbers with a 90 percent probability. Hence, the chance of guessing all ten numbers correctly for next year would be only 35 percent (0.9010). One may quibble that not all ten are independent variables, so we should not multiply them. True, but the number of variables is much greater than ten, and they are all at least semi-independent. Whichever way you evaluate the probability of guessing the next year’s financials correctly, it is probably worse than guessing heads or tails after tossing a coin.
But this was only for next year. I also need to project for the following year and the year after that. How accurate do you think my estimates will be?</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">假设我需要预测下一年的财务状况。我至少需要预测十个（甚至更多）数据，包括销售量、单价、销售成本、销售费用、应收账款、资本支出等等。再假设我是个出色的预测者，每个数字的预测准确率高达90%。那么，正确预测下一年全部十个数据的概率就只有35%（0.9的十次方）。有人可能会争辩说，并非所有十个变量都是独立的，因此不应该简单相乘。确实如此，但实际变量数量远超过十个，且它们至少是半独立的。无论你如何计算准确预测下一年财务数据的概率，结果很可能比抛硬币猜正反面还要低。

而这仅仅是针对下一年。我还需要预测后年以及大后年的数据。你认为我的预测能有多准确呢？</div>

In developing his theories, Darwin did not have special access to any confidential data or information. The Beagle trip did expose him to new lands and creatures, but he did not make any discoveries. During the five-year trip, Darwin did collect 1,529 species in spirits and 3,907 samples of skin, bone, and other specimens.22 But in all my research, I did not get the sense that he had stumbled upon anything significant unknown to science.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">我们仅编制过去十年或更长时间的财务数据。我们的财务追踪系统不包含任何预测，而是使用与其他所有人都能获取的相同客观财务信息。这与达尔文的研究方式并无二致。

            <div class="text-block original-text">There were occasions when experts enlightened Darwin with new facts about the specimens he had collected. For example, in 1845, Darwin’s botanist friend Joseph Hooker identified more than 200 plant species collected by Darwin and his team on Galápagos.23 About 150 of these were unique to single islands, but they were also related to plants on other islands that weren’t found anywhere else on Earth. Some plant ancestors, like those of the birds, had accidentally arrived on Galápagos a long time ago and had diversified into many species over time by adapting to the local environment.</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">Similarly, Linnaeus’s Systema Naturae was no secret. Its botanical classification system based on male and female sexes of plants had built Linnaeus’s reputation and fame. Linnaeus modified his sexual classification system of plants in his subsequent publication, Genera Plantarum. Genera classified plants based on what he called the “natural characters” of the genera: the morphological traits of flowers and fruits. However, neither he nor anyone else could explain the source of this natural order except to claim that it was God’s plan. Eighty years after Linnaeus’s death, Darwin finally explained this natural order by invoking his theory of common descent.
As you can see, in every case, Darwin had the same historical facts as everyone else. It was only his interpretations that were radically new and different. I would like to believe our approach is no different.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">同样，林奈的《自然系统》也并非秘密。其基于植物雌雄性别的分类体系早已为林奈赢得声誉与名望。在后续著作《植物属志》中，林奈修正了这套植物性别分类系统，转而根据植物属的"自然特征"——即花与果实的形态特征——进行分类。但无论是他还是其他学者，都无法解释这种自然秩序的来源，只能将其归因于上帝的安排。直到林奈去世八十年后，达尔文才用共同祖先理论最终阐明了这种自然秩序。

由此可见，达尔文掌握的历史事实与他人并无二致，真正具有革命性的是他独树一帜的诠释方式。我相信我们的研究方法亦当如此。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">If we don’t forecast financials, what do we do with historical numbers? A lot. As permanent owners, we are incredibly paranoid about the financial performance of our businesses. So here is the way we use historical financials to assess our portfolio companies.
Let me take the example of Berger Paints, India’s second-largest paint business. We have owned Berger since 2008. When Berger declares its quarterly results, we perform two broad historical analyses: absolute and relative.
For example, why has revenue growth declined to 10 percent over the past year compared to its longer-term average of 15 to 16 percent? What could be the reasons for high margins for the third year in a row? Has the company started spending less than usual on sales and marketing? What has led to a significant decline in receivables this quarter? Is the capital expenditure over the past year higher than usual? What has driven the increase in ROCE over the last two years versus the five years before?</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">如果我们不预测财务数据，该如何处理历史数据？用途颇多。作为长期持有者，我们对旗下企业的财务表现始终保持着高度警觉。以下是我们运用历史财务数据评估投资组合公司的方法。  

以印度第二大涂料企业伯杰涂料为例。自2008年持有伯杰以来，每当其公布季度业绩，我们会进行两大类历史分析：绝对分析与相对分析。  

例如：为何过去一年的营收增长率降至10%，而长期平均水平为15%至16%？连续三年利润率维持高位的可能原因是什么？公司是否减少了销售与营销的常规投入？本季度应收账款大幅下降的驱动因素是什么？过去一年的资本支出是否高于往常？相较于前五年，近两年资本回报率（ROCE）提升的关键动因何在？</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">We don’t stop at analyzing Berger’s results in the context of its long-term history. As permanent owners, we want to invest in a business that performs well on a relative basis; that is, one that performs better than the overall competition. We compare Berger’s quarter, last twelve months, and longer-term performance against the competition on parameters like revenue and profit market share, ROCE, and free cash flow, among many others. We track Berger primarily against four competitors: Asian Paints (the industry leader), Kansai Nerolac, Akzo Nobel, and Indigo. In addition, we seek market feedback on smaller or private businesses that may have started growing aggressively. This competitive analysis through the financials can lead us to ask if Berger has lost or gained market share this quarter and last year. What has driven Kansai’s increased revenue share over the past two years? Who is gaining the most from Akzo’s share loss? Has Indigo been able to expand outside Kerala? What is the trend in Berger’s advertising expenses relative to its competitors?</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">我们不仅将伯杰公司的业绩放在长期历史背景下分析。作为永久所有者，我们更希望投资于相对表现优异的公司——即那些比整体竞争对手表现更出色的企业。我们会从营收与利润市场份额、资本回报率、自由现金流等多项指标出发，将伯杰公司当季、近十二个月及长期表现与同行进行对比。主要选取四大竞品作为参照系：行业龙头亚洲涂料、关西涂料、阿克苏诺贝尔以及Indigo。同时也会收集市场对某些可能正在快速成长的中小型或非上市企业的反馈。这种基于财务数据的竞争分析能帮助我们厘清：伯杰本季度及去年市场份额是增是减？过去两年关西涂料收入份额提升的驱动因素是什么？阿克苏诺贝尔流失的份额被谁蚕食最多？Indigo能否成功拓展喀拉拉邦以外的市场？伯杰的广告支出与同行相比呈现何种趋势？</div>

Why fritter away time making useless forecasts with so much to do with the historical information we already have?
Assessing the Strategies of a Business
“Strategy” is a loaded word.

"战略"是个含义丰富的词汇。为便于讨论，我们将其定义为"企业在不确定条件下为实现目标而采取的所有行动"。纯粹主义者或许会纠结"战术"与"战略"的界定，但作为真金白银的投资者，我们更应关注实际问题。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">By now, I assume you can “predict” what I am about to write! Yes, we assess historical strategies to understand businesses. A small sample of strategic issues we focus on: Which customer segments have you targeted? How have your products or services served the needs of customers? In what ways have you been different from the competition? How have you allocated capital historically? What has been your capital structure, and why?
Two things may be evident to you as you read these questions: They are about the company’s strategic steps in the past, and these are issues that even a first-year undergrad could raise. What’s so great about these questions? Nothing. We ask these questions not to evaluate the answers objectively but to subjectively assess if they fit our preexisting hypotheses of success or failure. Yes, we know the answer we want before we have asked the first question.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">想必此刻你已能"预见"我要写的内容！没错，我们通过评估历史战略来理解企业。我们关注的战略问题包括但不限于：你们曾瞄准哪些客户群体？产品服务如何满足客户需求？与竞争对手的差异化体现在何处？历史上的资本配置方式如何？采用特定资本结构的原因是什么？

当你读到这些问题时，会发现两个明显特征：它们都关乎企业过去的战略决策，且都是连大一新生也能提出的基础问题。这些问题有何高明之处？毫无特别。我们提问并非为了客观评判答案，而是主观评估这些回答是否符合我们既定的成败假设。是的，在提出第一个问题前，我们心中早已有了期待的答案。</div>

We have our templates for success and failure, and we aim to assess if the company’s strategy fits a pattern. Very few do—more on this in chapter 6.
This approach is not very different from Darwin’s, who famously wrote in a letter to one Henry Fawcett in 1861, “How odd it is that everyone should not see that all observation must be for or against some view if it is to be of any service.”24 Darwin’s unique ability was to assess objective information—available to everyone—in the light of his subjective hypothesis.</div>

这种方法与达尔文的思路并无二致。他在1861年致亨利·福西特的信中写下名言："若观察要产生价值，必须支持或反驳某种观点，奇怪的是竟非人尽皆知。"达尔文的非凡之处，在于能依据主观假说来审视那些人人皆可见的客观信息。

            <div class="text-block original-text">Take his view on why there should be a struggle for existence. In 1798, Thomas Malthus, an English economist, published an essay on the principle of population growth.25 Malthus argued that the human population increases exponentially, whereas food resources grow linearly, so human prosperity will be impossible unless there are strict limits on reproduction. Further, Malthus wrote that unless humans started having fewer children, the inevitable food shortage would curse humanity to an eternal struggle for existence—only famine, war, and disease would check population growth. It was a dark and pessimistic view of humanity.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">以他关于生存竞争必然存在的观点为例。1798年，英国经济学家托马斯·马尔萨斯发表了一篇关于人口增长原理的论文。马尔萨斯认为，人口呈指数级增长，而粮食资源仅线性增长，若不严格控制生育，人类繁荣将无从实现。他进一步写道：除非人类减少生育，否则不可避免的粮食短缺将迫使人类陷入永恒的生存斗争——唯有饥荒、战争和疾病才能抑制人口增长。这是种阴暗而悲观的人类前景论断。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">Darwin read Malthus’s essay in 1838, and he extended the domain of applicability of Malthus’s principle to the entire living world.26 No one had done this before. I can’t do better than the master’s own words: “Every being, which during its natural lifetime produces several eggs or seeds, must suffer destruction during some period of its life, and during some season or occasional year[;] otherwise, on the principle of geometric increase, its numbers would quickly become so inordinately great that no country could support the product. Hence, as more individuals are produced than can survive, there must in every case be a struggle for existence. Either one individual with another of the same species, or with the individuals of distinct species, or with the physical conditions of life.”</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">达尔文于1838年读到马尔萨斯的论文，并将马尔萨斯原理的适用范围扩展至整个生物界。此前从未有人做到这一点。没有什么比这位大师的原话更能说明问题："凡在其自然寿命中产下多枚卵或种子的生物，在其生命中的某个阶段或特定季节/年份必定会遭遇消亡；否则根据几何级数增长原理，其数量将迅速膨胀到任何地域都无法承载的程度。因此，既然繁殖的个体数量远超存活量，就必然处处存在生存斗争——无论是同种个体之间、异种个体之间，还是与生存的物理环境之间。"</div>

However, no one else interpreted history the way he did.

His observations fit the template of the struggle for existence.</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">There is probably no better way to explain this than with a real example from the world of investing. We are shareholders in a company called NRB Bearings. Its owner and CEO, Harshbeena Zaveri, is an anthropology graduate from Wellesley. She is probably the best strategic thinker in our portfolio. NRB manufactures needle roller bearings for the automotive industry and has about 65 to 70 percent market share in India. The global giant Schaeffler accounts for the rest. Bearings account for just 1 to 2 percent of the cost of a vehicle but are critical components—failure can lead to severe accidents.</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">We avoid the automotive component space because, in general, its clients, the automotive companies, do not allow them to make money. In the United States, for example, the top five car companies controlled about two-thirds of the market in 2021.27 This concentration allows them to drive a tough bargain with their suppliers: the automotive component companies. Unsurprisingly, not many parts suppliers can consistently earn a decent profit. India is even more consolidated than the United States—the dominant car company, Maruti Suzuki, controls half the Indian market. The Indian motorcycle market is an oligopoly of just three companies. It is not unusual for a parts supplier to have a huge customer concentration—a top customer typically accounts for 30 to 50 percent of revenues.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">我们回避汽车零部件领域，因为该行业的客户——汽车制造商——通常不允许零部件企业盈利。以美国为例，2021年前五大汽车公司占据约三分之二市场份额，这种集中度使其能够对供应商（即汽车零部件企业）强势压价。因此，能持续获得可观利润的零部件供应商寥寥无几。印度市场集中度更甚——占据半壁江山的马鲁蒂铃木是绝对霸主，摩托车市场则由三家企业寡头垄断。零部件供应商常面临客户高度集中的局面，其最大客户往往贡献30%至50%的营收。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">Hence, our bias is to reject almost every automotive component business. There can be an exception, though. But that exception must fit the following template. First, the parts supplier would need to manufacture a critical component requiring proprietary technology and have a low customer concentration over many years. It should have only one or two competitors, and the competitive dynamics in the industry should be stable over the long term. Finally, there should have been no new entrants to the industry for many years, and the company should have delivered good financials historically. Note that not a single criterion here is about the future.
NRB ticked every box, and so when the company valuation came to the level we liked, we swooped in to buy 10 percent of the business. We studied history, built hypotheses, did not bother predicting, and have been happy owners in the business since 2013.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">因此，我们对汽车零部件企业几乎持全盘否定的态度。但例外情况确实存在——这类企业必须满足以下全部特征：首先，零部件供应商需掌握关键组件的专利生产技术，且客户分散度多年保持低位；行业竞争者仅存一两家，竞争格局长期稳定；该领域多年未见新进入者，同时企业需具备良好的历史财务表现。值得注意的是，这些标准全部基于历史事实，无一涉及未来预测。

NRB完美契合所有条件。当估值进入我们认可的区间时，我们迅速收购了其10%的股权。我们研究历史数据、建立分析框架、摒弃预测臆断，自2013年投资以来始终是这家企业的满意股东。</div>

Gauging the Competitive Position of a Business
Darwin discovered that the success of a species is not dependent on its being the best but simply being better than the competition. This joke will make it more straightforward. When two friends hiking in a forest spot a lion, one starts putting on his running shoes. His friend says, “What are you doing that for? You can’t possibly outrun a lion.” The man replies, “I know, but I need only to run faster than you, not the lion!”
We humans do not possess an ideal body or brain design, as those with back pain, hernias, or the desire to make leveraged crypto trades will confess. But as a species, we were undoubtedly better than tens of other sister species in the Homo genus, and that has allowed more than eight billion of us to rule the world.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">评估企业战略毫无意义，除非我们掌握理解战略的方法。

衡量企业竞争优势  
达尔文发现，物种的成功不在于成为最优，而只需胜过竞争者。这个笑话能更直观地说明问题：两名徒步者在森林里遇见狮子，其中一人开始穿跑鞋。同伴问："穿鞋有什么用？你不可能跑赢狮子。"那人答道："我知道，但我只需要跑得比你快就够了！"

人类并不具备完美的身体或大脑构造——饱受背痛、疝气之苦或热衷杠杆加密交易的人都会承认这点。但作为物种，我们无疑比人属其他数十个姊妹物种更具优势，这才让八十多亿人类得以主宰世界。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">Investors, analysts, and academics have beaten the term “sustainable competitive advantage” to death. Still, as in evolutionary theory, the real question is not just about sustainable competitive advantage but about being consistently better than the competition. And what is the meaning of “better”? For us, it relates to measurable parameters like ROCE, market share, free cash flow, balance sheet strength, consistency of financials, and other such measures.
We assess all these historically. So the question for us is never, “Will you be better than the competition,” but “Have you consistently been better than the competition?”</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">投资者、分析师和学者们早已将"可持续竞争优势"这一术语讨论得泛滥成灾。然而正如进化论所示，真正关键的问题不仅在于可持续竞争优势，更在于能否持续超越竞争对手。那么"更优"究竟意味着什么？对我们而言，这关乎可量化的指标：资本使用回报率、市场份额、自由现金流、资产负债表稳健性、财务数据持续性等衡量标准。

我们通过历史数据来评估这些指标。因此我们从不追问"未来能否超越竞争对手"，而始终聚焦于"是否持续保持着竞争优势"这一核心问题。</div>

If a company is consistently losing market share, and if SoftBank, Tiger, Alibaba, or Naspers has not offered a billion dollars to its competitors so they can burn cash mindlessly, no one can convince me that the company has a sustainable competitive advantage. On the other hand, if a company is consistently gaining market share, isn’t it highly likely that they have built a defensible moat? We want our businesses to gain market share over the long term, recognizing full well that the trend line may occasionally reverse in the short term.</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">In this context, it may be informative to share one of my early mistakes in the fund with you. This small-sized business was in a fragmented industry in which most businesses made decent ROCE. This business had ROCE of over 30 percent and had grown at an annualized rate of 29 percent over the previous three years. The company had no leverage. We invested at what we thought was an attractive price. After selling it at a loss of about 40 percent after five years, I concluded that price was the least of my problems. I had erred in sizing up the competitive advantage of the business.
The company had performed reasonably well in the past few years, but it had lost significant market share over the long term. The two most prominent players in the industry, founded around the same time as this company, were more than twenty times the revenue of this business. The third-largest business founded twelve years after the inception of our company was already eleven times larger in revenue.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">在此背景下，分享我在基金投资早期犯下的一个错误或许能带来启发。这家小型企业身处一个高度分散的行业，多数同行都能实现可观的投资资本回报率（ROCE）。该企业ROCE超过30%，过去三年年均增长率达29%，且没有负债。我们自认为以诱人价格完成了投资。然而五年后以亏损约40%斩仓时，我才意识到价格恰恰是最无关紧要的问题——真正的失误在于误判了企业的竞争优势。

尽管该公司过去几年表现尚可，但长期来看已丧失大量市场份额。行业前两大龙头企业创立时间与之相仿，营收规模却是它的二十余倍；而比它晚成立十二年的第三大企业，营收规模也已达到其十一倍。</div>

The company had been performing well recently, but, with a longer-term lens, I should have seen that the company was a chronic underperformer. Moreover, the same team of founder-managers had been running the business since its inception. So how could the following five-year result be any different from the past twenty-five?
I had made a big blunder. When it comes to gauging competitive position, barring some exceptions, there is almost nothing better than measuring market share of volume, revenue, and profit over a long period.
We live and learn.
Assigning Value to a Business</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">在我们的尽职调查过程中，管理层、客户甚至竞争对手提供了大量定性信息，说明公司近年来的战略方向已初见成效。虽然公司近期表现良好，但若以更长远的眼光审视，我本该发现这家公司长期处于业绩低迷状态。更何况，自创立以来始终是同一批创始人管理层在运营企业。那么接下来的五年业绩，又怎么可能与过去二十五年的表现有本质区别？

我犯了一个重大错误。在评估竞争地位时，除少数例外，几乎没有比长期观察市场份额、销量、收入和利润更可靠的衡量标准了。

企业估值之道</div>

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">60.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">A few years ago, a fund manager friend and I were meeting for coffee. He wanted to know how our portfolio was performing, and I started complaining mildly about the high valuation of our businesses. I wanted to buy more of these companies, but the prices seemed to have run up a lot. My friend was surprised and countered that the valuations weren’t too high. They seemed reasonable. I would say, “Company A is at 45 PE [price/earnings ratio],” and he would counter, “No, it’s only 25 PE.” I would then complain about Company Y being 55 PE, and he would appear surprised and correct me that the PE for the company was only 28. I was now frustrated, and he appeared pretty surprised—did I not know the valuation of my businesses?
And then it struck me.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">几年前，我和一位基金经理朋友喝咖啡时，他问起我们投资组合的表现。我随口抱怨了几句，说我们持有的企业估值太高。虽然想增持这些公司，但股价似乎已经涨了不少。朋友却露出诧异的神色，反驳说估值并不算高，完全在合理范围内。我提到"A公司的市盈率是45倍"，他立刻纠正："不对，只有25倍。"我又抱怨Y公司55倍的市盈率，他再次惊讶地指出那家公司实际市盈率仅为28倍。这让我倍感沮丧，而他满脸困惑——难道我连自己投资的估值都不清楚？

就在那一刻，我突然明白了。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">61.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">When I said 45 PE, I meant to say 45 times trailing PE. When he said 25 PE, he meant 25 times forward PE. His forward PE was not for the next year but for two years later! For those unfamiliar with our industry’s terminology, I had valued our business based on the actual delivered earnings of the past year. On the other hand, my friend had taken the average industry estimates of company earnings two years in the future and calculated the PE based on these forecasted earnings.
The following example will make this clearer. Let’s say that the profit after tax of a company in the past twelve months is $10 million and that its market value is $450 million. This gives a trailing PE of 45 (450 ÷ 10). If the consensus analyst estimates are that the company’s earnings will be $14 million next year and $18 million the year after that, the one-year forward PE for the same business will be 32 (450 ÷ 14), and the two-year forward PE will be 25 (450 ÷18).</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">当我说45倍市盈率时，指的是45倍追踪市盈率。而他说的25倍市盈率，是指25倍远期市盈率。他的远期市盈率甚至不是基于明年预测，而是两年后的数据！对于不熟悉行业术语的读者来说，我是用公司过去一年的实际盈利来估值，而我的朋友则采用两年后行业预测盈利的平均值来计算市盈率。

举例说明会更清晰。假设某公司过去十二个月的税后利润为1000万美元，市值为4.5亿美元，则其追踪市盈率为45倍（450÷10）。若分析师普遍预测该公司明年盈利1400万美元，后年1800万美元，那么一年远期市盈率为32倍（450÷14），两年远期市盈率则为25倍（450÷18）。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">Which of these three—45, 32, or 25—is the correct PE? It depends on the investor. For us, it is the backward-looking 45, and for my friend, it is the forward-looking 25. Most discussions of PE or other valuation ratios (like price/book or enterprise value/EBITDA) are forward-looking. The only PE ratio we discuss relates to the delivered earnings of the past. It may be the previous twelve months or the past three years, or, for some highly cyclical businesses, even the past ten-year average PE (i.e., current market value divided by the average earnings of the past ten years). We also use other valuation metrics, but all value the current business based on its past performance.
I can understand if some investors project earnings over one or two years since that’s not too far in the future. It’s not ideal, but I get it. What I fail to fathom is why investors do something worse. Much worse.
It’s called discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">这三个数字——45、32或25——哪个是正确的市盈率？这取决于投资者。对我们而言，它是向后看的45；而对我朋友来说，它是向前看的25。大多数关于市盈率或其他估值比率（如市净率或企业价值/息税折旧摊销前利润）的讨论都是前瞻性的。我们讨论的唯一市盈率与过去已实现的盈利相关——可能是过去十二个月、过去三年，或对某些强周期行业甚至采用过去十年的平均市盈率（即当前市值除以往十年平均盈利）。我们也会使用其他估值指标，但都是根据企业过往表现来评估当前价值。

我能理解部分投资者预测未来一两年盈利的做法，毕竟时间跨度不算太长。这虽非理想方式，但尚可接受。真正令我费解的是，为何有些投资者会采用更不可取的方法——糟糕得多的方法。这种方法叫作现金流折现分析。</div>

You need the cash urgently, and you ask Mom to give you the cash today instead. She will not give you $200 since the value of $100 in 2001 and 2002 is lower than in 2000 (yes, Mom is a stickler and a good mathematician). How much money should she give you? You will need a DCF analysis to arrive at the answer.
For this, you will need a discount rate or cost of capital.28 Mom decides that it should be 5 percent (maybe because this is the bank interest rate). Thus, the value of $100 in 2001 is $95 in 2000 ($100 ÷ 1.05). The value of $100 in 2002 is $91 in 2000 ($100 ÷ 1.052). Thus, if you choose to take all the money today, she should give you $186 ($95 + $91). This is a simple DCF analysis.
So far, so good.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">举个简单的例子：假设现在是2000年，你母亲承诺未来两年每年给你100美元。但你现在急需用钱，于是请求她将钱一次性在今天给你。她不会直接给你200美元，因为2001年和2002年的100美元价值低于2000年（是的，你母亲既严谨又精通数学）。这时该给你多少钱？你需要通过贴现现金流分析来找到答案。

为此，你需要确定贴现率或资本成本。你母亲决定采用5%（可能是参照银行利率）。因此，2001年的100美元在2000年价值95美元（100美元÷1.05），2002年的100美元在2000年价值91美元（100美元÷1.05²）。如果你选择现在一次性拿钱，她应该给你186美元（95美元+91美元）。这就是最简单的贴现现金流分析。

            <div class="text-block simplified-text">问题始于你用一家公司取代了母亲的角色。哇！我居然这么说了？但你明白我的意思。若不明白，容我解释。根据公司金融理论，企业价值不过是其所有未来现金流折现到当下的总和。这在学术层面成立，数学计算上也正确。但作为实际投资方法，它近乎荒谬。究其原因，搭建现金流折现模型需满足两大要素：折现率与现金流预测。

先谈折现率。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">65.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">The discount rate is the weighted average costs of debt and equity; it is equivalent to the 5 percent we used in the example with your mom. I understand the cost of debt, but what is the cost of equity? Corporate finance theory comes to the rescue and provides a clean-cut official formula. The formula is as follows: (risk-free rate) + β × (expected market return – risk-free rate). Looks neat, right? Just plug in the numbers to get the answer. Don’t be fooled, though; it hides several vast issues.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">折现率是债务与权益的加权平均成本，等同于前文母子借款案例中使用的5%。债务成本我能理解，但权益成本是什么？公司金融理论给出了清晰的标准公式：（无风险利率）+β×（预期市场收益率-无风险利率）。看起来简洁明了不是吗？只需代入数字就能得出答案。但别被表象迷惑——这个公式背后隐藏着若干重大缺陷。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">66.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Let’s begin with the Greek letter β (beta), which indicates riskiness. It measures the volatility of a stock relative to the market. Thus, a stock that moves in perfect synchrony with the market will have a β of 1. But, again, isn’t the notion of measuring risk by using volatility as a proxy quite silly? As I discussed in chapter 1, how does riskiness have anything to do with volatility? For an investor, the riskiness of a business is directly proportional to the probability of capital loss of investing in that business. The higher the potential loss, the higher the risk. I don’t care about β and never will.
As you can see in the formula, we need a number for the expected market return. Ask ten experts, and you will get ten different answers for expected market return. What number should I pick? Average, median, whatever I like? The formula has no advice to offer.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">让我们从希腊字母β（贝塔）开始，它代表风险系数。β值衡量个股相对于市场的波动性。因此，与市场完全同步波动的股票β值为1。但再次重申，用波动性来替代衡量风险的概念难道不是很荒谬吗？正如我在第一章所探讨的，风险程度与波动性究竟有何关联？对投资者而言，企业的风险程度直接取决于投资该企业可能损失本金的概率。潜在损失越大，风险就越高。我从不关心β值，将来也不会。

如公式所示，我们需要预估市场预期回报率。若询问十位专家，你会得到十个不同的市场预期回报率数值。我该选择哪个数字？平均值、中位数，还是任意偏好的数值？这个公式本身并未给出任何建议。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">67.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Do you see anything in the formula about how much debt the company is carrying? Do you think a company with a considerable debt load should have the same cost of equity as a company with no debt? The formula does not believe so. It is bizarre and almost laughable. Distressed companies with high leverage get sold for a pittance because the equity investors demand a high cost of equity.
As if all this is not enough, let’s look at the damaging impact of pretending that an impressive-looking math formula will protect us from egregious errors.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">公式中可曾提及公司的负债规模？你认为负债累累的公司和无债公司的股权成本应该相同吗？公式显然不这么认为。这简直荒谬到令人发笑。高杠杆的困境企业往往被贱卖，正是因为股权投资者要求极高的股权成本。

更糟的是，人们竟妄想光鲜的数学公式能避免重大失误——这种自欺欺人造成的危害，我们不妨来看看。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">68.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Let’s go back to your mom. If she decides to discount cash flow by 7 percent instead of 5 percent, she will give you only $181, not $186. But if she discounts at 3 percent, you will receive $5 extra, or $191. A DCF analysis assumes cash flows in perpetuity, and so the present value of this formulation is much more sensitive to the discount rate than the one used by your mom. For example, assume that a cash flow of $100 grows by 10 percent over twenty-five years. Using a discount rate of 10 percent, the discounted present value of this series is $2,273. What if we reduce the discount rate by just one percentage point to 9 percent? The value jumps by 13 percent to $2,565. Similarly, a one-percentage-point increase in discount rate chops off 11 percent of the present value.
What’s the use of fooling oneself that the mathematical precision of a discount rate with two decimal places is any better than guesswork?</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">让我们回到你母亲的例子。如果她决定用7%而非5%的折现率计算现金流，你只能得到181美元而非186美元；若折现率降至3%，你将多获得5美元，即191美元。现金流折现分析假设现金流永续存在，因此这种计算方式的现值对折现率的敏感度远高于你母亲采用的方法。例如：假设100美元现金流在25年内以10%增长，使用10%折现率时，该系列现金流的折现现值为2,273美元。若将折现率仅下调1个百分点至9%，价值就会跃升13%至2,565美元；同理，折现率上调1个百分点会导致现值缩水11%。

自欺欺人地认为保留两位小数的折现率能比猜测更精确，这种想法有何意义？</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">69.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">And now, believe it or not, we come to the real problem of using DCF. Yes, we haven’t even started yet!
Back to Mom. She had promised us $100 for the next two years. Can a company promise to do the same for an indefinite future? Of course not. But the DCF technique demands that we forecast cash flows. So that is what everyone does.
Theoretically, I need to make these projections in perpetuity, but for convenience, I will just use a “terminal value” at the end of the tenth year to make my task easy. Let’s not wade into the problems of terminal value, which is a cesspit. Trust me; you will get indigestion.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">信不信由你，现在我们要讨论使用现金流折现法的真正难题了。没错，我们甚至还没开始呢！

回到老妈那个例子。她承诺未来两年每年给我们100美元。但哪家公司能承诺永远如此呢？当然不可能。然而现金流折现法要求我们必须预测现金流，所以大家只能照做。

理论上，这些预测应该无限期持续下去。但为图方便，我直接在第十年末设定一个"终值"来简化计算。我们暂且别深究终值这个烂摊子——相信我，这会让你消化不良的。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">Even if you aren’t from the financial community, you may have read or heard of the stock prices of individual companies suddenly dropping or increasing massively. Let’s take the example of Snapchat, an app that every teenager with a smartphone seems to be using.29 In early May 2017, Snapchat’s share price dropped almost 25 percent in a single day after the company declared financial results that showed slower growth than expected and a massive loss of $2.2 billion. There was a lot of public information available on the company, and since Snapchat had listed only recently, investors and analysts had analyzed its future cash flows in gory detail. They had not foreseen the abysmal financial results.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">即便你并非金融界人士，或许也读过或听说过某家公司股价突然暴跌或暴涨的新闻。以青少年智能手机用户几乎人手一款的Snapchat应用为例——2017年5月初，该公司公布财报显示其增长不及预期且亏损高达22亿美元后，股价单日暴跌近25%。当时市场关于该公司的公开信息非常充分，加之Snapchat上市不久，投资者和分析师曾对其未来现金流进行过极为详尽的预测。但所有人都未能预见这份惨淡的财报。</div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">71.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">If investors can’t forecast cash flows even a few days or months in advance, how can they be expected to project cash flows years ahead? But this is what the DCF methodology demands. Investors and analysts rarely fail to build massive, complicated financial models that assess dozens of factors to project cash flows over many years in the future. Hail Excel.
It’s not that the builders of these Excel models—whether analysts, bankers, consultants, or investors—are unaware of the pitfalls. But for some reason, the deep desire to look far in the future to arrive at an exact number overwhelms the rational voice admonishing the person to stop pretending they are doing anything useful.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">若投资者连几天或几个月后的现金流都难以预测，又怎能指望他们预估多年后的现金流？但这正是贴现现金流法所要求的。投资者和分析师们总是不厌其烦地搭建庞大复杂的财务模型，评估数十项因素来预测未来多年的现金流。电子表格软件可谓居功至伟。

这些模型的构建者——无论是分析师、银行家、咨询顾问还是投资者——并非不清楚其中的陷阱。但出于某种原因，人们内心深处对精确预测远期数字的渴望，总会压倒理性声音的告诫——这种声音本应提醒他们停止自欺欺人的行为。</div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">72.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">One of the best ways for you to get a sense of this future obsession is to read the transcripts of a company’s quarterly results conference calls. Most companies post such transcripts in their websites’ “Investor Relations” section. I analyzed three conference call transcripts—for Walmart (for Q2 2018), P&G (for Q4 2017), and General Motors (for Q2 2017)—and the results are stark.
For Walmart, analysts and investors focused twenty-eight out of forty-nine questions on the future (e.g., “implied EBIT margin direction within the guidance”). On the P&G call, fourteen out of twenty questions asked the management to make some kind of prediction (e.g., “Do you have more initiatives hitting the market?”). At General Motors, a staggering twenty-seven out of thirty-three questions were forward-looking (e.g., “What should we think about the cadence of the expected savings from the restructuring actions?”).</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">要理解这种对未来的执念，最有效的方式莫过于阅读企业季度财报电话会议的实录。多数公司会在官网"投资者关系"版块公布这类记录。我分析了三家企业——沃尔玛（2018年第二季度）、宝洁（2017年第四季度）和通用汽车（2017年第二季度）的会议实录，结果令人震惊。

在沃尔玛的会议中，分析师与投资者提出的49个问题里，有28个聚焦未来（例如"指引中隐含的息税前利润率走向"）。宝洁的20个提问里，14个要求管理层做出预测（比如"是否有更多市场推广计划即将启动？"）。通用汽车的33个问题中，惊人的27个具有前瞻性（例如"该如何评估重组行动带来节约效益的预期节奏？"）。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">The tug-of-war between the analyst and the management team is occasionally painful to witness: The former tries to pin down exact forecasts for revenues and margins (so that they can populate the DCF model). Knowing full well that the future is inherently unpredictable, the latter attempts to sidestep the question with some broad generic comments.
For example, on the General Motors call for Q2 2017, an analyst wanted to know the revenue projection for OnStar, an advanced communication system installed in GM cars. The answer from the CFO was, “As we have talked about before, yes, OnStar is generating revenue. We don’t disclose it separately. It continues to grow.” My sympathies lie with company management; they know that they don’t know what the future will bring. But, on the other hand, most analysts and fund managers, having never worked in a company, think that it is the management’s job to know the future; how else how will they be able to populate their DCF models?</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">分析师与管理团队之间的拉锯战有时令人不忍直视：前者试图锁定确切的收入和利润率预测（以便填充现金流折现模型），而后者深知未来本质上不可预测，便试图用些笼统的套话搪塞过去。

例如在2017年第二季度通用汽车财报电话会上，一位分析师想了解车载高级通讯系统OnStar的收入预期。首席财务官的回答是："正如我们之前所说，OnStar确实在创造收入，但我们不单独披露这项数据。它保持着增长态势。"我倾向于同情企业管理层——他们清楚自己无法预知未来。但另一方面，多数从未在企业工作过的分析师和基金经理却认为预判未来是管理层的职责，否则他们如何填充自己的现金流折现模型呢？</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">I have been on the boards of more than twenty-five companies, and over the years I have never seen a management team meet its budgets. Some exceed their projections, and some undershoot. Occasionally, the over- or underperformance is by a wide margin. If the company management can’t forecast correctly, how can investors do so? They can’t. More importantly, they shouldn’t try.
We have never done a DCF analysis and never will. However, I know many—if not most—investors and analysts do. Maybe they have figured out a method to look far into the future that eludes me. In any event, our approach is straightforward.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">我曾担任过二十五家以上公司的董事，多年来从未见过哪个管理团队能达成预算目标。有些超出预期，有些未达预期，偶尔还会出现大幅偏离的情况。既然公司管理层都无法准确预测，投资者又怎能做到？他们做不到。更重要的是，他们本就不该尝试。

我们从未做过现金流折现分析，将来也不会做。但我知道许多（甚至可能是大多数）投资者和分析师都在用这种方法。或许他们掌握了某种我无法参透的预测未来的方法。无论如何，我们的策略很简单。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">Let me take the example of a noncyclical business growing at a moderate pace. We know the market-trailing PE multiple is about 19 or 20. We pay a multiple at or below the market for an exceptional business with high ROCE, a wide moat, and low business and financial risk. Occasionally, we stretch a bit by paying a trailing multiple in the high teens or low 20s for a truly unique business, but these occasions are few and far between. The median trailing PE multiple for our portfolio when we bought the companies is 14.9.
We refine this method for cyclical businesses and those that haven’t shown steady growth in earnings (e.g., if earnings stayed flat for the previous five years or doubled in the past year). But the general principle is that we assign a fair valuation based on historical, delivered financials.
Oh, one last point on valuation. It is always the last thing we discuss. When evaluating a business, risk comes first, quality second, and valuation last.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">以一家增速平稳的非周期性企业为例。当前市场平均市盈率约为19至20倍，而我们仅以等于或低于市场水平的估值倍数，投资那些资本回报率高、护城河宽广、商业与财务风险低的优质企业。极少数情况下，对于真正稀缺的特殊企业，我们会适度放宽标准，接受18至23倍的历史市盈率——但这类机会凤毛麟角。我们投资组合中被收购企业的历史市盈率中位数仅为14.9倍。

对于周期性企业或盈利增长不稳定的公司（例如过去五年盈利持平或去年突然翻倍的企业），我们会调整这套方法。但核心原则始终不变：基于历史财务表现给予合理估值。

关于估值还有最后一点：这永远是我们最后讨论的要素。评估企业时，风险排第一，质量居其次，估值永远在最末。</div>

In the words of Douglas Futuyma, a professor at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, “The core of evolutionary biology consists of describing and analyzing the history of evolution, and of analyzing the causes and mechanisms of evolution.”30 As a result, the natural world throws up several questions that we can’t answer without drawing inferences about historical processes. For example, why do females fight over males in some species? Why are there two sexes and not five? Why does only a tiny part of our genome code for proteins? Why do lions commit infanticide? How did birds evolve from dinosaurs?</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">必要条件未必充分  
纽约州立大学石溪分校的道格拉斯·富图玛教授指出："进化生物学的核心在于描述和分析进化的历史，并探究进化的原因与机制。"因此，自然界提出了许多问题，若不借助历史进程的推演，我们便无法解答。例如：为何某些物种中雌性会争夺雄性？为什么存在两种性别而非五种？为何人类基因组中只有极小部分编码蛋白质？狮子为何会杀害幼崽？鸟类又是如何从恐龙演化而来的？</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">As long-term investors, we have dissociated ourselves from the “what will happen?” obsession and replaced it with “what has actually happened?” The former is a laundry list of conjectures and opinions, and the latter, to a large extent, consists of facts. Of course, facts in and of themselves are empty, and what matters is the opinions we build onto those facts, but at least they give us a foundation for a discussion.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">作为长期投资者，我们已摆脱对"未来会怎样？"的执念，转而关注"实际发生了什么？"。前者是连篇累牍的推测与臆断，后者则主要由事实构成。当然，事实本身并无意义，关键在于我们基于事实形成的见解——但至少它们为讨论提供了根基。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">For example, if a company has had a historical ROCE over the past decade of 40 percent, two investors could have widely different opinions of this “fact.” One could assert that the company has a great future, and the other could argue that microeconomic theory demands that these returns will be competed away. Understanding that the company has had unusually high returns in the past focuses the investors’ attention on the sources of these returns and their sustainability. For example, did the company earn these returns because of regulatory protection from overseas competition, and, if so, are we comfortable backing a business that has not faced genuine competition? Or were these returns earned despite fierce competition? What has the company done relative to the competition that has made it so unique?</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">例如，若某公司过去十年的资本运用回报率（ROCE）高达40%，两位投资者对这一"事实"可能持有截然不同的观点。一方可能断言该公司前景光明，另一方则可能依据微观经济学理论，认为这种回报率终将被市场竞争消弭。认识到该公司曾创下异常高的历史回报率，能促使投资者聚焦于这些回报的来源及其可持续性——究竟是因为监管政策屏蔽了海外竞争（若是如此，我们是否愿意投资一家从未经历真实竞争的企业），还是在激烈竞争中依然实现了高回报？相较于同行，该公司究竟凭借何种独特优势创造了这样的业绩？</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">Our focus on interpreting the present in the context of history is not free of problems. Let me share two categories of issues. Both relate to the issue of necessity versus sufficiency of track record.
The once-famous company Nokia exemplifies the first category of issues. Nokia was a high-flying company in the late 1990s and dominated the mobile phone market in the same way that the iPhone does today.31 Large emerging markets like China and India were severely underpenetrated in the mobile phone sector in the 1990s. Based on historical performance, it appeared that Nokia would conquer the world.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">我们以历史为镜解读当下的做法并非全无问题。容我分享两类典型困境，它们都涉及历史记录的必要性与充分性之争。

诺基亚这家昔日巨头正是第一类问题的绝佳例证。上世纪90年代末，这家风光无限的企业主宰着移动电话市场，其地位堪比今日的iPhone。当时中国、印度等新兴市场的手机普及率极低，从历史表现来看，诺基亚似乎注定要征服全球市场。</div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">80.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Investors couldn’t buy enough Nokia stock, and, at its peak in the year 2000, Nokia’s market value was about $325 billion. Since then, it has lost more than 90 percent of its value. In the year 2000, all the historical signals from the company—its financial performance, competitive position, reputation, and dealer and customer feedback—would have screamed, “This is an amazing company.” But Nokia could not compete with Apple, Samsung, or tens of local Chinese and Indian competitors over the next decade, and the Nokia phone is now a museum relic.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">投资者曾对诺基亚股票趋之若鹜，2000年其市值巅峰时高达约3250亿美元。然而此后其市值暴跌逾90%。回溯2000年，这家公司的所有历史信号——财务表现、竞争地位、品牌声誉、经销商及用户反馈——无不呐喊着"这是家卓越的企业"。但随后的十年间，诺基亚终究不敌苹果、三星及数十家中国与印度本土厂商的竞争，如今诺基亚手机已成为博物馆里的陈列品。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">Anyone relying only on the history of Nokia would have suffered massive losses. Giving weight to a track record is a necessary condition for investment success, but it is in no way sufficient. We find this to be especially true in fast-changing industries that may or may not be technology related. Thus, in the case of Nokia, while most historical signals would have led one to conclude that the company had been truly outstanding, the very nature of the technology industry, in which rapid change is the norm, should have made any investor pause.
We have avoided fast-changing industries like the plague, and many are not even in the technology space. Industries like retailing, microfinance, food delivery, and e-commerce are in the early stages of evolution in India. There is way too much turmoil in these industries for us to feel comfortable using only historical information to invest.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">仅凭诺基亚的历史表现进行投资的投资者必将遭受巨额亏损。重视过往业绩虽是投资成功的必要条件，但绝非充分条件。我们发现这一规律在快速变化的行业中尤为显著——无论这些行业是否与技术相关。以诺基亚为例，尽管多数历史数据都显示该公司曾极其卓越，但科技行业本质就是瞬息万变，仅此一点就应让所有投资者保持警惕。

我们像躲避瘟疫般规避快速变化的行业，其中许多甚至不属于科技领域。零售、小额信贷、外卖和电子商务等行业在印度尚处发展初期。这些行业动荡剧烈，仅靠历史信息投资会让我们如坐针毡。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">Should an investor avoid technology companies and other rapidly evolving industries? We do, mainly because we are unable to decipher historical signals for companies in these industries. But many investors have figured out ways of assessing these industries. I don’t know how to analyze fast-evolving sectors and businesses, so I don’t. When encountering a Nokia-like business, I am very comfortable saying, “I can’t figure this out, so thanks, but no thanks.”
We can summarize the second problem of historical analysis in one word: Starbucks.
In this case, relying on history would not have helped us identify a spectacular turnaround, thereby depriving us of potentially a substantial money-making opportunity. Howard Schultz bought Starbucks in 1982, and from a mere four stores in Seattle, he grew it to about $2 billion in revenue by 2000. Unfortunately, he left Starbucks in 2000 owing to exhaustion, and not long after, Starbucks started underperforming.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">投资者是否应该避开科技公司和其他快速发展的行业？我们确实如此，主要是因为我们无法解读这些行业中公司的历史信号。但许多投资者已经找到了评估这些行业的方法。我不懂如何分析快速变化的行业和企业，所以选择回避。当遇到类似诺基亚这样的企业时，我会坦然表示："我搞不明白，所以谢谢，但恕不参与。"

我们可以用一个词概括历史分析的第二个问题：星巴克。  
在这个案例中，依赖历史数据无助于我们发现惊人的逆转，从而错失潜在的重大盈利机会。霍华德·舒尔茨于1982年收购星巴克时，这家公司仅有西雅图的四家门店。在他的经营下，到2000年星巴克已实现约20亿美元营收。遗憾的是，舒尔茨因过度劳累于2000年离开公司，此后不久星巴克便开始走下坡路。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">When Schultz returned to the company in 2008, there was bad news all around.32 Sales had been flagging for some time. McDonald’s and Dunkin’ Donuts had dramatically increased pressure on the company by launching their own gourmet coffee brands. As a result, the stock price had fallen by almost half over the previous year. From 2008, Schultz led a dramatic turnaround in Starbucks’ fortunes by cutting back on expansion, closing hundreds of stores, creating a new instant coffee brand, and refocusing on the consumer. Investors fell in love with the company again—the stock price jumped more than eighteen-fold from December 2008 to December 2019.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">2008年舒尔茨回归公司时，坏消息接踵而至。销售额长期低迷不振，麦当劳与唐恩都乐通过推出精品咖啡系列大幅施压。受此影响，星巴克股价在过去一年间暴跌近半。自2008年起，舒尔茨通过收缩扩张规模、关闭数百家门店、创立全新速溶咖啡品牌、重塑消费者核心等举措，带领星巴克实现惊人逆转。投资者重拾对公司的信心——2008年12月至2019年12月期间，股价暴涨逾十八倍。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">Let’s take ourselves back to 2008 when everything seemed to be falling apart at Starbucks. All the historical signals—customer feedback, market share, same-store sales growth—pointed to a company struggling to regain its lost glory. Schultz may have been the CEO eight years previously, but the company had changed a lot since then; there were thousands of new stores, the management was different, and customer and competitor behavior were different, too. Schultz may have revived the company, but there is no evidence that founders are the best turnaround artists. In 2008, given the lack of historical data pointing to a turnaround, I would not have invested in the company and lost out on a huge potential gain.
What is the solution? I don’t know a way, but if you can somehow figure out a company’s future in a fast-changing industry or bet on a turnaround, all power to you.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">让我们将时间倒回2008年，当时的星巴克似乎正分崩离析。所有历史信号——顾客反馈、市场份额、同店销售额增长——都表明这家公司正在艰难重振昔日荣光。舒尔茨虽在八年前担任过CEO，但公司已今非昔比：新增数千家门店，管理层大换血，顾客与竞争对手的行为模式也截然不同。尽管舒尔茨曾让公司起死回生，但并无证据表明创始人就是最佳的扭亏专家。2008年时，鉴于缺乏预示转机的历史数据，我绝不会投资这家公司，因而错失了巨大的潜在收益。

解决之道何在？我尚无良策。但若有人能在瞬息万变的行业中预判企业未来，或敢于押注绝地反弹，那便尽显其能了。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">For the rest of us who are mere mortals, relying on history is a time-tested way to keep the odds firmly in our favor. Of course, it will not guarantee a win every time—no investment approach can—but it will allow us to win often enough.

I changed seven schools in twelve years because my father was in the armed forces, and they transferred him every two years. These were all government schools where the quality of teachers wasn’t usually the best, to put it mildly. However, I doubt even the best private schools had someone like the incredible Mr. Rathod.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">对于我们这些普通人而言，依托历史经验是久经考验、能始终让胜算倾向于己方的策略。当然，这无法保证每次都赢——没有任何投资方法能做到——但足以让我们经常获胜。

由于父亲在军队服役，每两年就会调任一次，我在十二年间换了七所学校。委婉地说，这些公立学校的师资水平通常不尽如人意。但即便是顶尖私立学校，恐怕也找不出像拉索德先生这样非凡的老师。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">We had recently arrived in a small town called Jamnagar when I was in grade 7. I was miserable because I had to bid farewell to my friends in the previous town (called Dehu Road), and I found it hard to fit in socially at this new school. However, Mr. Rathod and his history class got me through that year. He refused to teach us history from the prescribed textbook. Instead, he ordered us to use the school library to read about ancient and modern Indian history from books and popular comics. And then he asked each student to pick a topic and educate the class on what they had learned. Of course, the rest of us were free to disagree with the presenter, and Mr. Rathod encouraged us to be methodical and logical in our arguments. I distinctly remember a group of twelve-year-olds almost coming to blows when debating the British influence on India.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">七年级那年，我们刚搬到名为贾姆讷格尔的小镇。离开德胡路的朋友们让我郁郁寡欢，新学校的社交圈也令我难以融入。所幸拉索德老师的历史课伴我度过了那段时光。他拒绝照本宣科，而是要求我们去学校图书馆研读印度古今历史的书籍和流行漫画，再自选主题为同学们授课。每当有人分享时，其他人都可以自由反驳——拉索德先生总鼓励我们进行条理分明的逻辑论证。我至今清晰记得，一群十二岁的孩子为"英国对印度影响"的议题争得面红耳赤的场面。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">Before meeting Mr. Rathod, history for me was objective, undisputed, unchanging. Before him, every history teacher had drilled into me that there was only one correct answer to any question. Mr. Rathod taught us that most answers to questions in a history test should begin with, “It depends.” Throughout grade 7, he showed us directly and indirectly that history can teach us less about who they were and much more about who we are.
The notion that we can all be great investors just by gauging history is nonsense. It has been fundamental to our process, but it works for us because of who we are. So I bring my prejudices and biases to something as simple as a historical balance sheet. Occasionally, there are vehement disagreements on how to interpret the past. It occurs even within our small, well-knit team, which has worked together for many years. In the middle of these fiery debates, I often yearn for Mr. Rathod. Why couldn’t he be here to adjudicate this?
Chapter Summary</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">在遇见拉索德先生之前，历史于我而言是客观的、无可争议的、永恒不变的。此前的每位历史老师都向我灌输：每个问题只有一个正确答案。而拉索德先生教导我们，历史试卷上的大多数答案都应以"视情况而定"开头。整个七年级期间，他通过直接和间接的方式向我们展示：历史与其说能让我们了解"他们是谁"，不如说更能让我们认清"我们是谁"。

那种认为仅凭衡量历史就能成为伟大投资者的想法荒谬至极。历史分析虽是我们投资流程的基石，但奏效的原因在于我们自身的特质。因此即便面对一份简单的历史资产负债表，我也会带着个人成见与偏见。关于如何解读过去，我们时常爆发激烈争论——即便在我们这个合作多年的紧密小团队内部也不例外。每当置身这些火药味十足的辩论中，我总会怀念拉索德先生：要是他能来裁决该多好。

            <div class="text-block original-text">Evolutionary theory has taught me that . . .
. . . we investors can reimagine investing by studying and understanding the history of a business and an industry instead of constantly obsessing over the future.
1. Darwin, the founder of modern evolutionary theory, understood better than anyone before him that the present was the result of the cumulative effect of the past.
2. He proposed his three groundbreaking theories—natural selection, sexual selection, and common descent—by construing history in a new light.
3. Unlike physics and chemistry, the science of evolutionary biology does not make predictions. Rather than answering the question, “What will happen to humans?” it ponders over the conundrum, “How did bipedal humans evolve from an ancestral quadruped ape?”
4. The investment world is obsessed with the future. Studying history has taken a backseat to making bold forecasts.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">进化论教会我……  
……我们投资者可以通过研究和理解企业与行业的历史来重新构想投资方式，而非一味执着于预测未来。  

1. 作为现代进化论奠基人的达尔文，比前人更透彻地认识到：当下是过去累积作用的结果。  
2. 他通过重新诠释历史，提出了自然选择、性选择和共同祖先三大开创性理论。  
3. 与物理化学不同，进化生物学不做预测。这门学科不回答"人类将何去何从"，而是思考"双足人类如何从四足猿类演化而来"的命题。  
4. 投资界痴迷于预测未来。研究历史已让位于大胆的预言。

            <div class="text-block original-text">5. Taking a leaf out of evolutionary biology, we focus exclusively on widely and openly available historical information to analyze businesses. We spend no time building projections and forecasts.
6. We develop a point of view on company financials, strategy, competitive position, and valuation by analyzing what has already happened without bothering about what will happen.
7. However, concentrating on the past does have two main downsides. We may wrongly assume that (1) a historically successful business will continue to be so, or (2) a failed or failing business will continue to be so.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">5. 借鉴进化生物学的思路，我们仅聚焦于广泛公开的历史信息来分析企业，既不耗费时间构建预测模型，也不进行业绩推演。  
6. 我们通过分析既成事实来形成对企业财务状况、战略布局、竞争地位及估值水平的判断，而非纠结于未来走向。  
7. 然而专注历史数据存在两大弊端：可能错误地认定（1）历史上成功的企业将永远成功，或（2）曾经失败或衰退的企业注定持续衰败。</div>
