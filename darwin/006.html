I am inclined to believe that in nearly the same way as two men have sometimes independently hit on the very same invention, so natural selection, working for the good of each being and taking advantage of analogous variations, has sometimes modified in very nearly the same manner two parts in two organic beings, which owe but little of their structure in common to inheritance from the same ancestor.
Charles Darwin, On the Origin of Species, chapter 6, “Difficulties of the Theory”
Charlie and I have many reasons to be thankful for our association with Chuck and See’s. The obvious ones are that we’ve earned exceptional returns and had a good time in the process. Equally important, ownership of See’s has taught us much about the evaluation of franchises. We’ve made significant money in certain common stocks because of the lessons we learned at See’s.

            <div class="text-block original-text">Tim Cooper had no idea that that cold and windy Saturday morning in a lab at Michigan State University in January 2003 would be one of the most important of his life.
Tim started performing his well-rehearsed routine. He had done it dozens of times over the past three years, but he knew that he had to be very careful. He was. The experiment had been going for fourteen straight years, and he was not going to be the one responsible for any mishap.
First, he took a set of twelve new flasks and carefully measured exactly 9.9 milliliters of fluid into each. Next, he went to the incubator and removed the twelve old flasks housing generation number 33,127. He would inoculate the new flasks with 0.1 milliliters of fluid from each of these twelve old flasks. But he needed to check the old flasks first.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">2003年1月那个寒风凛冽的周六早晨，蒂姆·库珀在密歇根州立大学的实验室里并未意识到，这将是他人生中最重要的时刻之一。

他像往常一样开始执行那套演练过无数遍的流程。过去三年里他重复了数十次，但深知必须万分谨慎。事实也是如此——这项持续了十四年的实验，绝不能在他手上出任何差错。

他首先取出十二个新烧瓶，往每个瓶中精确量入9.9毫升培养液。接着从恒温箱里取出编号第33,127代的十二个旧烧瓶。按照流程，他需要从每个旧烧瓶中抽取0.1毫升培养液接种到新烧瓶里。但在操作前，他必须仔细检查这些旧烧瓶。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">He picked up two of them and saw what he expected. The next two flasks also seemed acceptable. But in the third set of two flasks, in the flask labeled “Ara-3,” he saw that the fluid had turned opaque instead of being mildly cloudy like in the other old flasks. That shouldn’t have happened. The lab had seen similar problems in the past owing to contamination. There was a strict protocol for solving the issue, and Tim was well versed in it.
Tim replaced the “faulty” old Ara-3 flask and came back on Sunday to check the outcome. Of course, he expected the usual result. But he was in for the same surprise: The new Ara-3 flask, too, had turned turbid.
Something was very wrong. Or very right.
The Astonishing Anoles
Our investment strategy has an unusual feature. We don’t invest in individual businesses. It may seem like we do, but we don’t.
What in the world do we invest in then?</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">他拿起其中两个烧瓶，看到了预料之中的景象。接下来两个烧瓶的状态似乎也正常。但检查到第三组烧瓶时，在标着"Ara-3"的容器里，他发现液体变得浑浊不透光——其他旧烧瓶只是略显朦胧。这不该发生。实验室曾因污染出现过类似问题，对此有严格的解决流程，蒂姆对此驾轻就熟。  

蒂姆更换了"有问题"的旧Ara-3烧瓶，周日回来查看结果。他本以为会看到常规现象，却再次遭遇意外：新换的Ara-3烧瓶同样变得混浊。  

这要么大错特错，要么妙不可言。

            <div class="text-block original-text">Let’s do an evolutionary thought experiment to answer the question. Imagine another Earth-like planet that is at a similar distance from its sun-like star. This is not entirely improbable since there are a billion trillion (1021) stars in the universe. Would this planet evolve the same life forms as those on Earth? How likely is it to have honeysuckles and hornbills?
Philosophers may have pondered this question for millennia, but the first modern scientist to attempt an answer was the late Harvard paleontologist and evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould. In his excellent book Wonderful Life, Gould took the position that evolution was unpredictable: “Replay the tape a million times . . . and I doubt that anything like Homo sapiens would ever evolve again.”</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">让我们用一个进化思想实验来回答这个问题。想象另一个类地行星，它距离其类太阳恒星的位置与地球相似。这并非完全不可能，因为宇宙中存在十亿万亿（10²¹）颗恒星。这颗行星会进化出与地球相同的生命形式吗？出现忍冬花和犀鸟的可能性有多大？

数千年来，哲学家们可能一直在思考这个问题，但首位尝试给出科学解答的现代学者是已故哈佛古生物学家兼进化生物学家斯蒂芬·杰伊·古尔德。在其著作《奇妙的生命》中，古尔德提出进化具有不可预测性："即便将生命磁带回放百万次……我怀疑智人这样的物种能否再次出现。"</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">If the “evolutionary tape” were replayed a million times, each outcome would depend on two opposing forces. On the one hand, the nonrandom force of natural selection would ensure that organisms develop a small set of foreseeable solutions to the obstacles imposed on them by the environment. On the other, chance mutations and rare environmental events would make any kind of prediction impossible. Which would win? “The bad news is that we can’t possibly perform the experiment,” Gould mused.
The good news is that although we can’t perform the experiment, nature can and has. Do you want evidence? Let’s start with lizards.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">倘若将"进化磁带"重播百万次，每次结果都将取决于两股相悖的力量。一方面，自然选择这股非随机力量会确保生物体针对环境障碍演化出少量可预见的解决方案；另一方面，随机突变和罕见的环境事件将使任何预测都成为徒劳。哪股力量会胜出？"坏消息是我们永远无法进行这个实验，"古尔德沉思道。

好消息是：虽然人类无法实验，大自然却可以且已经完成了。需要证据吗？让我们从蜥蜴说起。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">More than seven hundred Caribbean islands are home to about one hundred and fifty species of lizard called anoles (genus Anolis). All the Caribbean species are the descendants of just two species that arrived from the mainland millions of years ago. Dr. Jonathan Losos, a professor of biology at Washington University, has been studying the anoles since the late 1980s on the four larger Caribbean islands of Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, and Puerto Rico.1
Professor Losos discovered that the one hundred and fifty species across these four islands are broadly clustered into six groups, or “ecomorphs”: Trunk, Twig, Crown-giant, Trunk-crown, Trunk-ground, and Grass-bush. This classification rests on body length, tail length, limb length, toe pad lamellae (scales on the feet of the anoles that help them stick to a surface), color, and habitat.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">加勒比海域七百余座岛屿上栖息着约一百五十种蜥蜴，统称安乐蜥（学名Anolis）。这些物种皆源自数百万年前从大陆迁徙而来的两种祖先。华盛顿大学生物学教授乔纳森·洛索斯博士自1980年代末起，便以古巴、牙买加、伊斯帕尼奥拉和波多黎各四大加勒比岛屿为研究基地，持续追踪这类生物。

洛索斯教授研究发现，四大岛屿上的一百五十种安乐蜥可归纳为六大生态形态类群：树干型、细枝型、冠丛巨人型、树干-冠丛型、树干-地面型及草丛型。该分类体系基于多项体征指标：体长、尾长、四肢长度、趾垫片层（足部帮助吸附表面的鳞片结构）、体色以及栖息地特征。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">For example, the Trunk ecomorph lives on tree trunks, has an average body length of about five centimeters, has a short tail, and is gray. A very different ecomorph, the Grass-bush, lives in the grasses and bush, has an average body length of four centimeters, has a very long tail, and is brown.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">例如，栖息在树干上的"树栖型"生态形态平均体长约五厘米，尾部短小，体色灰暗。与之截然不同的"草丛型"生态形态生活在灌木草丛中，平均体长四厘米，尾部极长，通体呈棕褐色。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">The behavioral and physical traits of various anole ecomorphs have adapted very well to the anoles’ unique local environments. Thus, the long tail of the Grass-bush ecomorph helps the anole achieve spectacular balance on narrow and unstable surfaces like blades of grass, and its brown color melds with the color of the bush and grasses. The Trunk ecomorph is very different because it has a solid tree trunk underneath its feet for most of its life—it does not need a long tail for balance. But it does need its gray color, which can provide camouflage against the gray tree trunk, thereby fooling its predators and prey. The Twig anole has short legs to help it navigate the small twigs on which it lives. Finally, the Trunk-ground ecomorph has evolved long legs to run efficiently on tree trunks and the ground.
No surprises here—Darwinian natural selection is alive and well on the gorgeous islands of the Caribbean.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">各类生态型安乐蜥的行为与生理特征，已完美适应其独特的生存环境。例如，草灌生态型的长尾能帮助它们在草叶等狭窄不稳定的表面上保持惊人平衡，其褐色体色也与灌木草丛融为一体。树干生态型则截然不同——它们终生以坚实树干为活动场所，无需长尾维持平衡，但需要灰色体色伪装，与灰白树干融为一体以迷惑天敌与猎物。枝栖生态型演化出短腿以适应细枝间移动，而地栖生态型则发展出修长的后肢，便于在树干与地面高效奔跑。这一切毫无意外——达尔文式的自然选择，正在加勒比海瑰丽群岛上生动上演。</div>

Thus, the Trunk ecomorph in Cuba looks and behaves very similarly to the Trunk ecomorph in Hispaniola, and the Crown-giant ecomorph in Puerto Rico is indistinguishable from the one in Jamaica.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">然而令人惊讶的是，这四个岛屿上出现了相同的生态形态。例如，古巴的树干生态型在外形和行为上与伊斯帕尼奥拉岛的树干生态型极为相似，而波多黎各的冠巨生态型与牙买加的冠巨生态型几乎无法区分。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">I know what you are thinking: Are the Trunk anoles the same species that colonized Cuba and Hispaniola? DNA analysis has demonstrated that they aren’t! The six ecomorph anoles on the island of Cuba are much more closely related to one another than they are to anoles on other islands. Thus, the Trunk anoles in Cuba are much more closely related to the Twig anoles in Cuba than to the Trunk anoles in Hispaniola. The anoles living on tree trunks on the islands of Cuba and Hispaniola are very different species but have developed the same physical and behavioral characteristics on encountering similar environments. This is true for all six ecomorphs. When presented with a specific problem, the Caribbean anoles on different islands have evolved the same solutions, such as tail length, body length, and color. Amazingly, they have done it independently of one another.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">我明白你的疑问：古巴与伊斯帕尼奥拉岛的树干栖安乐蜥是否属于同一物种？DNA分析给出了否定答案！古巴岛上六种生态形态的安乐蜥彼此间的亲缘关系，远比它们与其他岛屿安乐蜥的关系更为密切。因此，古巴的树干栖安乐蜥与同岛的细枝栖安乐蜥的亲缘关系，比与伊斯帕尼奥拉岛的树干栖安乐蜥更为接近。生活在古巴和伊斯帕尼奥拉岛树干上的安乐蜥虽是完全不同的物种，却在相似环境中演化出相同的生理特征与行为模式。这一规律适用于全部六种生态形态。当面对特定生存挑战时，不同岛屿的加勒比安乐蜥会独立演化出相同的解决方案——无论是尾部长度、躯干尺寸还是体色。最令人惊叹的是，这些演化过程完全独立发生。</div>

Convergence Is Ubiquitous
The fascinating example of convergence in Caribbean anoles is a rule, not an exception, in the natural world.
Dolphins are mammals just like us, and sharks are fish. But their fusiform body shapes are pretty similar, and, more interestingly, they have the same coloration. Both have a light underbelly and darker back, making them harder to spot from above and below. George McGhee, a paleontologist, claims that the reason sharks, dolphins, tuna, and the extinct ichthyosaur look alike is that there is only one way for a fast-swimming animal to evolve.3</div>

海豚是与人类同属的哺乳动物，鲨鱼则属于鱼类。但它们的流线型躯体极为相似，更耐人寻味的是体色也完全一致：浅色腹部与深色背部使捕食者无论从上或下方都难以察觉。古生物学家乔治·麦吉指出，鲨鱼、海豚、金枪鱼及已灭绝的鱼龙之所以外形雷同，是因为高速游动生物仅有一种演化路径。</div>

Australia punches much above its weight in the sporting world. This nation of only twenty-five million people won 547 medals in the Summer Olympics (before Tokyo 2020), exceeding many nations much more significant in population.5 For example, its medal tally is one-fifth that of the United States, whose population is thirteen times larger.

Australia was part of the supercontinent Pangea and its southern segment Gondwanaland, which started breaking apart about 180 million years ago. As a result, Australia has been a free-standing continent for about 35 million years. The mammals on this massive island have been taking a unique evolutionary path during this time.
The Australian mammals are all marsupials who give birth to undeveloped young ones and raise them in an external pouch; most of the world has placental mammals (like us) who give birth to fully developed infants. Does the dramatic difference in their life histories and development process mean that marsupials look very different from the placentals? Surprisingly not.</div>

澳大利亚哺乳动物全属有袋类，它们产下未发育完全的幼崽并在体外育儿袋中哺育；而世界上其他地区多为胎盘类哺乳动物（如人类），直接诞下发育成熟的幼体。这种生命历程与发育过程的巨大差异，是否意味着有袋类动物与胎盘类动物外貌迥异？令人惊讶的是——并非如此。</div>

Congratulations, you have designed the marsupial anteater (called the numbat) as well as the placental anteater. As you may expect, they look surprisingly alike.

Convergence is ubiquitous and not limited just to the external appearance or morphology of animals. It is also widely observed and documented in animal behavior and in plants, fungi, and even bacteria.
Let’s start with behavior. What do you think these four species—a cobra, a stickleback fish, an octopus, and a spider—share? There is no convergence in body form here, unlike the Caribbean anoles.

Each large leaf was being carried by a single tiny ant, who purposefully disappeared underground to pass on the booty to her specialist sisters. These ants chew the leaves to grow a fungus garden used for food for the entire colony.

Let’s move on to plants. Most of us have had coffee, tea, and chocolate (derived from cacao). The Brazilians among us will be familiar with the drink Guaraná Antarctica, made from the guaraná plant in the Amazon rainforest.

Plants have many defense mechanisms against predators, and it appears that some have converged toward the same solution: producing caffeine.

He has explained convergence by saying, “Certainly it’s not the case that every Earth-like planet will have life let alone humanoids. But if you want a sophisticated plant, it will look awfully like a flower. If you want a fly, there are only a few ways you can do that. If you want to swim, like a shark, there are only a few ways you can do that. If you want to invent warm-bloodedness, like birds and mammals, there are only a few ways to do that.”

We Don’t Invest in Individual Businesses
Earlier in the chapter, I made the following assertion about our investment strategy: We don’t invest in individual businesses. It may seem like we do, but we don’t.
So what in the world do we invest in then?
We invest in convergent patterns. We seek patterns that repeat. As we saw, “replaying the tape of life” often yields the same result. We operate on the principle that the business world is no different. There is a big difference between asserting “I love this business” and “I love this business construct.” We are fans of the latter, not the former.

There was a lot of interest from many investors (or so the bank led us to believe!). The company processed credit cards and had shown modest growth over the past few years. Unsurprisingly, the investment bank’s projections showed dramatic growth starting the following year. Skeptical initially, I met the management team and talked to industry participants and investors in the business. Then, after reviewing India’s low credit card penetration rates, I convinced myself that while the management’s and the bank’s projections were aggressive, they weren’t too far off the mark.

I want to emphasize that this was neither the bank’s nor the management’s fault. They were doing their job. But, unfortunately, I forgot to do mine.
A few years after this disaster, when I looked back at the projections, I realized that we would have saved our precious capital if I had applied the principle of convergence by asking a few simple questions. The questions I should have asked but did not were as follows: “Sure, credit card penetration is low in India, but so is penetration for every consumer product. What other consumer products in India have seen these growth rates over the long term? Do you have examples of other countries where we have seen such rapid credit card growth? If so, was their stage of development similar to India’s today?” I should have demanded a convergent template, but I didn’t.</div>

数年后复盘这场败局时，当我重新审视那些预测数据，才惊觉倘若当时运用趋同思维提出几个简单问题，本可保住宝贵资金。那些我本该追问却遗漏的问题是："印度信用卡普及率确实很低，但所有消费品的渗透率都不高。该国还有哪些消费品能长期保持这种增长率？其他国家是否出现过信用卡如此迅猛的增长案例？若有，当时它们的发展阶段与现今印度是否具备可比性？"我本该要求对方提供趋同参照模板，却未能践行。</div>

Naukri允许求职者免费发布简历，同时向企业收取订阅费以获取简历库并发布职位空缺。2013年我们投资时，Naukri以65%的流量份额占据绝对主导地位，规模是当时第二大平台Monster India的四倍。鉴于这种统治地位，印度求职者几乎必然会在Naukri上传简历；而招聘企业也不得不订阅其服务，因为这里汇聚着最庞大且多元的候选人资源。这正是经典网络效应的典范：Naukri之所以成为第一，正是因为它已经是第一。</div>

It was not unusual for leading Yellow Pages businesses to earn a profit margin in excess of 40 percent.11 While Naukri operates in a different era in a different medium, our view was that it converged with many of the virtuous traits of a leading Yellow Pages business.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">这些企业具备极强的防御性优势，行业龙头更因网络效应长期享有高额利润。领先的黄页企业利润率超过40%实属常态。尽管Naukri身处不同时代的媒介环境，但我们认为它汇聚了顶尖黄页企业的诸多良性特质。</div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">31.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">The second convergent pattern we noted was the performance of the leading internet job boards in other countries. This pattern was even more powerful than that of Yellow Pages. We found at least seven other job boards globally with obscenely high operating margins (more than 30 to 40 percent) and infinite ROCE, just like Naukri; for example, Seek in Australia, Dice and CareerBuilder in the United States, 51Job in China, EN in Japan, 104 Corp in Taiwan, and JobStreet in Singapore and Malaysia. These dominant franchises became more dominant each year. Their margin and return profile kept improving; they were all cash machines; the number two in any of these markets showed no signs of catching up; and LinkedIn and offline competitors had no impact on them. In other words, they were indistinguishable from Naukri.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">我们观察到的第二个趋同模式是其他国家领先网络招聘平台的表现。这一模式比黄页公司的案例更具说服力。全球范围内我们至少发现另外七家招聘平台与Naukri类似，拥有高得惊人的运营利润率（超过30%至40%）和无限的投资资本回报率，例如澳大利亚的Seek、美国的Dice和CareerBuilder、中国的51Job、日本的EN、台湾的104 Corp以及新加坡和马来西亚的JobStreet。这些占据主导地位的企业每年都在扩大优势：其利润率和回报率持续提升；它们都是现金奶牛；各自市场的第二名毫无赶超迹象；领英和线下竞争者对其毫无影响。简而言之，它们与Naukri如出一辙。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">When we first encountered a 49 percent operating margin and infinite ROCE for Naukri, we were skeptical. Who earns that kind of money? But after studying the Yellow Pages and companies in other markets, we concluded that this was no fluke. In 2021, Naukri’s operating margin was 55 percent.
We invested in Naukri not just because Sanjeev and Hitesh are impressive folks (which they are), or because Naukri makes gobs of money (which it does), or because it has annihilated the competition (which it has). Instead, we invested in Naukri because the convergent models of Yellow Pages and global job board businesses gave us the confidence to believe that the Naukri template is tough to beat. Make that almost impossible to beat.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">当我们首次看到Naukri公司49%的营业利润率和无限高的资本回报率时，我们持怀疑态度——谁能赚到这种利润？但在研究黄页和其他市场的企业后，我们认定这绝非偶然。2021年Naukri的营业利润率已达55%。

我们投资Naukri不仅因为桑吉夫和希泰什是令人钦佩的创业者（确实如此），也不仅因其能创造惊人利润（事实如此），更不单是它碾压了所有竞争对手（确实碾压）。我们投资的核心逻辑在于：黄页与全球招聘平台的商业模式融合，让我们确信Naukri的模式几乎不可战胜。准确地说，是根本不可能被击败。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">I will state two counterfactuals to highlight the importance of this method of investing. First, what if Sanjeev and Hitesh, impressive as they are, were operating the number 2 or 3 job board in India? We would not have touched the business. Winner takes all in the classifieds business, and we would never have bet against that pattern. Second, what if Sanjeev and Hitesh had come to us in the early days of the internet when there was no proof of concept for this business model? Again, we would have walked away because the answer to the question “Where else has this worked?” would have been “No idea.”
Nevertheless, some venture capitalists did fund Naukri in its early days. Kudos to them. They recognized the genius of Sanjeev and Hitesh and deserved their mouthwatering returns.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">我将用两个假设情景来凸显这种投资方法的重要性。首先，如果桑吉夫和希泰什（尽管能力出众）运营的是印度排名第二或第三的招聘网站呢？我们绝不会投资。分类广告行业赢家通吃，我们从不逆势下注。其次，如果桑吉夫和希泰什在互联网早期尚未验证该商业模式时就来找我们呢？我们同样会放弃，因为对于"这种模式在其他地方成功过吗"的答案将是"毫无头绪"。

然而确实有风投机构在Naukri初创期提供了资金。向他们致敬——他们识别出桑吉夫和希泰什的才华，最终也获得了令人艳羡的回报。</div>

If it hasn’t, we are unlikely to touch it. We are the antithesis of the venture capital community, which earns its living by betting on untested and unproven businesses. I am in awe of successful venture capital firms, but my admiration for them will never translate into a desire to emulate them.
Kahneman’s Outside View and Convergence</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">我们厌恶"这次不一样"和"直觉告诉我这能成"这类说辞。我们需要看到投资逻辑在其他地方验证过的证据。若缺乏实证，我们绝不会贸然出手。我们与风险投资界截然相反——后者赖以生存的正是押注未经检验的商业模式。我钦佩成功的风投机构，但这份敬意永远不会转化为效仿他们的冲动。

            <div class="text-block original-text">I have learned to invest by investing and by observing other investors. I wish I could have learned from the learned finance and economics academics. Have you tried reading a finance journal or research article on economics or finance? I have, and I must admit I can’t understand most of them. They are inundated with Greek symbols, complicated mathematical equations, and esoteric arguments. They leave me baffled as to their utility for actual practitioners like me. But occasionally, one of the intellectuals will take my breath away.
Daniel Kahneman is one such individual. His masterpiece Thinking, Fast and Slow should be compulsory reading for all investing 101 classes. If you are already an investor, there is no more valuable chapter to read (and re-read) than chapter 23, “The Outside View.”</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">我的投资之道源于亲身实践与观察他人。多希望当初能向金融经济学者们求教——可你试着读过金融期刊或经济金融论文吗？我读过，但不得不承认大多不知所云。满篇希腊字母、复杂方程式和晦涩论证，让我这种实战派根本摸不着头脑。不过偶尔，某些智者会让我震撼不已。

丹尼尔·卡尼曼正是这样的人物。他的杰作《思考，快与慢》理应成为所有投资入门课的必修教材。若你已是投资者，最值得反复研读的莫过于第23章《外部视角》。</div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">36.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Here, Kahneman describes his experience of leading a team in Israel designing a curriculum and writing a textbook for high school students on judgment and decision-making. After a year, the team had made reasonable progress. They had prepared a detailed outline of the syllabus, written a couple chapters, and conducted some classroom lessons.
One day, Kahneman asked his colleagues to write down an estimate of the time it would take the team to submit a finished textbook draft to the Ministry of Education. Everyone on the team, including Kahneman’s colleague Seymour Fox, an expert in curriculum development, estimated that it would take them about two years. Kahneman then asked Fox, who had witnessed many other teams develop similar textbooks and curricula over the years, how long it usually takes teams to finish their textbook projects.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">卡尼曼在此描述了他在以色列领导团队的经历——为高中生设计关于判断与决策的课程并撰写教材。一年后，团队取得了合理进展：完成了详细的教学大纲框架，撰写了几章内容，并进行了部分课堂授课。  
某天，卡尼曼让同事们预估团队还需多久能将完整教材草案提交教育部。包括课程开发专家西摩·福克斯在内的所有成员都认为大约需要两年。卡尼曼随即询问福克斯——这位见证过多年间其他团队编写类似教材的同行——此类项目通常实际耗时多久。</div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">37.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Fox’s answer stunned Kahneman. Seemingly embarrassed, Fox admitted that 40 percent of such teams never finished the task, and those who did took anywhere from seven to ten years. The actual time it took Kahneman’s team? Eight years. A far cry from the two years they had estimated.
Kahneman labels the team’s initial estimate of two years the “inside view.” It was based on the team members’ specific circumstances, their confidence in their abilities, an extrapolation based on recent goals achieved, and a hazy idea of the future. And it was wrong by a wide margin.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">福克斯的回答让卡尼曼震惊不已。他略显尴尬地承认，这类团队中有40%根本完不成任务，而完成任务的团队耗时七到十年不等。卡尼曼团队实际耗费的时间？整整八年——与他们最初预估的两年相去甚远。

卡尼曼将团队最初两年的预估称为"内部视角"。这个判断基于团队成员的特殊处境、对自身能力的信心、根据近期达成目标所做的推算，以及对未来的模糊构想。最终证明这个预估出现了巨大偏差。</div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">38.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Kahneman calls the 40 percent failure estimate of similar projects and the completion time of seven to ten years the “outside view.” As he describes, his questioning of Fox revealed two great insights. First, although Fox was aware of the outside view, he did not even consider it while initially writing down his estimate. And second, although the other team members, including Kahneman, did not have access to the information Fox did, none even attempted to understand the outside view when the project began.
But applying convergent thinking or an outside view is neither natural nor easy. As Kahneman himself states succinctly, “ ‘Pallid’ statistical information is routinely discarded when it is incompatible with one’s personal impression of a case. In the competition with the inside view, the outside view does not stand a chance.”</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">卡尼曼将类似项目40%的失败率预估以及七至十年的完成周期称为"外部视角"。他指出，对福克斯的追问揭示了两大洞见：首先，尽管福克斯知晓外部视角的存在，但在最初写下预估时却完全未予考虑；其次，包括卡尼曼在内的其他团队成员虽未掌握福克斯所知的信息，却在项目启动时无人尝试理解外部视角。  
但运用聚合思维或外部视角既非本能也非易事。正如卡尼曼精辟总结："当苍白的数据统计与个人对案例的主观认知相冲突时，人们往往会弃用前者。在与内部视角的较量中，外部视角毫无胜算。"</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">The outside view does not have a chance in the investment community because, ironically, fund managers and analysts are savvy. Given a choice between applying their intellectual horsepower to a single business by making a ten-year projection of profits or stepping back and asking if any of it even makes sense, brilliant folks often choose the former. As I was transitioning from consulting in my early investing days, I was the biggest believer in the myth that more work produces better answers for investors. It doesn’t.
Let me illustrate the power of Kahneman’s outside view by outlining two ways of analyzing a potential investment in an airline.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">在投资界，外部视角毫无立足之地——讽刺的是，正因为基金经理和分析师们太过精明。当面临选择时，这些聪明人往往更愿意将脑力耗费在对某家企业进行十年利润预测上，而非退后一步质疑整个逻辑是否成立。我初入投资行业从咨询转型时，曾是"付出越多努力就能为投资者带来更好答案"这一谬论最虔诚的信徒。但事实并非如此。

            <div class="text-block original-text">Imagine that I have just flown to Singapore from New York aboard the über-comfortable A380 in January 2019. I have thoroughly enjoyed the legendary Singapore Airlines service. After I land, I pick up a financial newspaper and read an interesting article on the enormous potential for airlines in Asia, particularly in India and China. This article also informs me that the famous Tata Group in India launched not one but two airlines a few years ago. The journalist gushes about the limitless growth possibilities on the continent. Having just had a great flying experience and feeling excited about the potential of the fast-growing Asian airline market, I decide to start some serious work on the subject to evaluate an investment in an Asian airline.
If you are not from the finance industry, please do not treat this as a frivolous example. Believe it or not, this is how fund managers sometimes get interested in companies.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">设想我在2019年1月乘坐极度舒适的空客A380，从纽约飞抵新加坡，全程享受着新加坡航空传奇般的优质服务。落地后，我随手拿起一份财经报纸，读到一篇关于亚洲航空业巨大潜力的有趣报道，尤其聚焦印度和中国市场。文章还提到，印度著名的塔塔集团几年前竟同时创办了两家航空公司。记者热情洋溢地描绘着这片大陆无限的增长前景。刚体验完完美的飞行服务，又对亚洲航空市场的高速发展充满期待，我决定深入研究这个领域，评估投资亚洲航空公司的可行性。

            <div class="text-block original-text">At first glance, there is a lot to like about the airline industry. But, to a fund manager’s ears, I can describe it in two words that sound better than Beethoven’s symphony: “large” and “growing.” Unless you live in a monastery in a remote corner of the world, your life in the modern world, directly or indirectly, is touched by the airline industry. And the industry is beginning to impact Africa and Asia—the phenomenal growth of Dubai and Singapore as airline hubs during the last decade is testimony to the region’s potential.
At this stage, I have two options:
1. Perform a detailed analysis of one Asian airline, or
2. Focus on understanding the outside view of the airline industry.
If I choose option one, which, incidentally, many fund managers choose, I will waste my time doing the following time-consuming and futile tasks.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">乍看之下，航空业有许多令人称道之处。但在基金经理听来，我只需用两个比贝多芬交响曲更动听的词就能概括："规模庞大"与"持续增长"。除非隐居在世外桃源，现代人的生活总在直接或间接地与航空业产生交集。该行业正开始影响非洲和亚洲——过去十年迪拜和新加坡作为航空枢纽的崛起，便是该地区潜力的明证。

此刻我面临两个选择：
1. 对某家亚洲航企进行深度分析；
2. 着重理解航空业的宏观图景。

若选择第一条路径（顺便提一句，这正是多数基金经理的选择），我将把时间耗费在以下既耗时又徒劳的工作上。</div>

Then, we will visit their corporate offices, where the senior management team will wax eloquent on the culture and systems of their unique airline. Finally, we will read tens of analyst reports (most of which will be favorable; do you seriously expect an airline analyst to denigrate their industry?), and we will build a fancy Excel spreadsheet with multiyear forecasts of fuel prices, passenger miles, average ticket prices, load factors, gross margins, capital expenditures, inventory levels, lease costs, personnel expenses, marketing costs, airport charges, freight revenues, and heaven knows what else.
The result? After many weeks or months of meetings and late nights, we will either buy or choose a price at which we plan to purchase the company’s shares if we think the price is too high.
Let’s see what we would do if we were to choose option two instead.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">我和团队将在一家高档餐厅采访首席执行官与首席财务官。随后我们将造访其公司总部，高管团队将在那里对其航空公司的独特文化与制度体系大加颂扬。最后我们将研读数十份分析师报告（其中绝大多数必然唱好——难道真指望航空业分析师贬低自己的行业？），并精心制作包含多年预测数据的Excel表格，涵盖燃油价格、客运里程、平均票价、载客率、毛利率、资本支出、库存水平、租赁成本、人力开支、营销费用、机场收费、货运收入等项目，天知道还会塞进哪些指标。

            <div class="text-block original-text">We want to analyze the industry in greater depth, and so we start with an extensive study conducted by MIT on the U.S. airline industry from 2000 to 2013. The conclusions of this study are in an eighty-one-page document available for free on the internet.12 The results are humbling.
Surprisingly, despite being a mature market, the U.S. industry grew during this period: The revenue of passenger miles grew about 20 percent from 709 million to 848 million. However, on total revenue of about $1.4 trillion during this period, the airlines made a cumulative loss of $44 billion. Thus, on an annual revenue of close to $100 billion, the airline industry lost about $3 billion every year from 2000 to 2013.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">我们希望更深入地分析该行业，因此从麻省理工学院针对2000至2013年美国航空业开展的一项广泛研究入手。这项研究的结论发布于一份八十一页的公开文件，可在互联网免费获取。研究结果令人警醒。

令人惊讶的是，尽管处于成熟市场阶段，美国航空业在此期间仍实现了增长：客运里程收入从7.09亿增长至8.48亿，增幅约20%。然而在这段总收入约1.4万亿美元的时期里，航空公司累计亏损达440亿美元。这意味着在每年接近1000亿美元营收的规模下，2000至2013年间航空业年均亏损约30亿美元。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">44.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">But these averages hide an even sorrier story. During eight of these fourteen years (or almost 60 percent of the time), the airlines made no money; that is, they declared financial losses or only a meager profit. And in the six years they did manage to eke out profits, their total net profit was only about $40 billion.
However, the real tragedy is that during just two bad years—2005 and 2008—the industry suffered losses of $54 billion, or $14 billion more than the cumulative profits of $40 billion during the entire period. It is generally assumed that the tragedy of September 11, 2001, was terrible for the airline industry, which is true; U.S. airlines suffered losses of about $19 billion in 2001 and 2002. But in 2005, four years after the tragedy and three years before the financial meltdown of 2008, the industry declared a total net loss of $28 billion, far exceeding the losses resulting from September 11.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">然而这些平均数掩盖着更可悲的事实。在这十四年间，航空公司有八年（即近60%的时间）处于零盈利状态——财务报表显示的要么是亏损，要么是微薄利润。即便在勉强盈利的六年里，全行业净利润总额也仅约400亿美元。

更触目惊心的是，仅2005与2008这两个灾年，行业总亏损就高达540亿美元，比整个周期累计利润还多出140亿。人们通常认为2001年"9·11事件"对航空业打击最大，事实确是如此：2001至2002年间美国航司共亏损约190亿美元。但2005年——距恐袭四年后、2008金融危机三年前——全行业净亏损竟达280亿美元，远超"9·11"造成的损失。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">The remarkable consistency with which airlines lose money is not a problem unique to the United States. A report from the International Air Transport Association shows that from 2000 to 2014, the industry had not earned its cost of capital for fifteen years in a row.13 Not even in a single year!
You must now be thinking what I am thinking. The industry may be destructive overall, but what about the top airlines? Would they not be much better than the industry? Let’s look at the return profiles of the top ten airlines (by revenue) in the world according to Aviation Week: Lufthansa, All Nippon, Southwest, Qantas, Air China, American, Singapore, Turk Hava, Aeroflot, and Ryanair. Using Morningstar, I calculated their return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA) for ten years from 2004 to 2013, and the results are terrible. The median ROE of these airlines over ten years was 6.8 percent, and the median ROA was 2.5 percent. Scale does not guarantee success in this demanding industry.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">航空公司持续亏损的惊人现象并非美国独有。国际航空运输协会的报告显示，2000年至2014年间，该行业连续十五年未能赚回资本成本，甚至没有一年实现盈利。

此刻你大概与我心有戚戚：虽然行业整体表现糟糕，但头部航空公司呢？它们的表现难道不会远超行业水平？让我们根据《航空周刊》的全球营收前十榜单——汉莎航空、全日空、西南航空、澳洲航空、中国国航、美国航空、新加坡航空、土耳其航空、俄罗斯航空和瑞安航空——来考察其收益状况。通过晨星数据，我计算了这些公司2004至2013十年间的净资产收益率（ROE）与总资产收益率（ROA），结果触目惊心：十年期中位数ROE仅为6.8%，ROA低至2.5%。在这个严苛的行业里，规模并不能确保成功。</div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">46.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">To sum it up: It’s as bad as it gets.
After studying the historical patterns in the airline industry, we can conclude the following with a high degree of confidence:
1. U.S. airlines do not make money.
2. The global airline industry does not make money.
3. The top ten airlines in the world do not make money.
The detailed and unfortunate outside view of the industry is quite troubling. Airlines are great for consumers, not for investors. This pessimistic view advises us to stay away from the airline industry. Instead, we should choose to invest our excess cash in a bank deposit rather than buying a single airline share.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">简而言之：糟糕透顶。  
通过对航空业历史模式的研究，我们可以高度确信以下结论：  
1. 美国航空公司不赚钱。  
2. 全球航空业不赚钱。  
3. 全球十大航空公司不赚钱。  

这一行业详尽而令人沮丧的外部视角相当令人不安。航空业对消费者有利，对投资者却无益。这一悲观看法建议我们远离航空业，而应将闲置资金存入银行，而非购买任何航空公司的股票。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">I am sure many of you are now asking the obvious question. Can one make a decision about investing in an Asian airline based on learnings from U.S. and global airlines? If we can conclude that Asia is not dissimilar to the United States, maybe we can get comfortable with the fact that the fate of Asian airlines will be no different from their U.S. counterparts. At first glance, the industry may appear to be quite different in Asia owing to ownership and international routes. First, most airlines in Asia, including Singapore Airlines, are owned by the government, unlike in the United States, where airlines are under private ownership. Second, most of the heavy traffic routes in Asia are between international destinations, not domestic ones (there are no domestic flights in Singapore or Dubai!).</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">我相信此刻许多人心中都有一个显而易见的疑问：能否根据美国和全球航空业的经验，来决定是否投资亚洲航空公司？如果我们能得出亚洲与美国并无本质差异的结论，或许就能坦然接受亚洲航空公司的命运与其美国同行别无二致这一事实。乍看之下，由于所有权结构和航线网络的差异，亚洲航空业似乎截然不同。首先，亚洲大多数航空公司（包括新加坡航空）均为政府所有，而美国航司则普遍由私人控股；其次，亚洲的高密度航线主要集中于国际航线而非国内航线（新加坡和迪拜甚至根本没有国内航班！）。</div>
        </div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">48.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">But if we dig a bit deeper into the competitive dynamics, we may conclude that Asia is no different from the United States. In the prepandemic days, Expedia showed that if you wanted to fly from Singapore to New York, you could choose from among twenty-two airlines! Competition is no less severe just because the flights are international as opposed to domestic. The airline rivalry in Asia may be more intense than in the United States owing to the ownership structure! Since governments care much less about economics than private investors, they may not be perturbed by continued financial losses. Moreover, most countries seem to treat their airline as a national symbol, so shutting down a national airline, as prudent as it may be for the exchequer, is unheard of in Asia. As a result, in my view, invoking convergence to understand the Asian airline industry is a legitimate investment approach.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">但若深入剖析竞争态势，便会发现亚洲与美国并无二致。疫情前数据显示：从新加坡飞往纽约的航线，旅客竟能在22家航空公司中自由选择！国际航线的竞争激烈程度丝毫不逊于国内航线。由于所有权结构特殊，亚洲航空业的厮杀或许比美国更为惨烈——政府远比私人投资者更不看重经济效益，即便连年亏损也安之若素。更何况多数国家将本国航司视为民族象征，像关闭国营航空公司这种虽有利于财政却伤及体面的事，在亚洲简直闻所未闻。正因如此，我认为用趋同理论来解读亚洲航空业，实为一种合理的投资分析框架。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">In this case, applying the outside view to investing yielded us two significant benefits. First, we avoided investing in a company and in an industry in which the odds of making money are very slim indeed. I am not suggesting that it is impossible to make money by investing in airlines—if you bought an airline stock at a low enough price (no, I can’t define what is “low enough”) and then were lucky enough to sell it at some profit, good for you. But “I will find a greater fool for my crappy asset” is another way to say “speculating,” not investing. It’s not for us.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">在这种情况下，采用外部视角进行投资为我们带来了两大显著优势。首先，我们避免投资于一家公司乃至整个行业——事实上，在这个领域获利的概率微乎其微。我并非暗示投资航空公司绝对无法盈利——如果你以足够低廉的价格购入航空股（具体何为"足够低"我无法界定），而后又幸运地在获利时抛售，那自然值得庆贺。但"为我的劣质资产寻找更愚蠢的接盘者"不过是"投机"的另一种说辞，绝非投资之道。这不符合我们的原则。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">50.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">The second benefit was the time, money, and effort saved. Instead of conducting lengthy and unproductive management meetings, schmoozing the investor relations person, paying fat fees to consultants, and spending weeks to construct a multimegabyte Excel spreadsheet, we spent a few hours on the internet, downloaded a few reports, and made our decision within a few minutes with enough time left to go home early to our families.
Some Practical Ways of Applying the Principle of Convergence
This discussion on airlines should not lead anyone to believe that all will be well just by applying the principle of convergence or the outside view to a specific investment situation. Convergence is not a panacea, nor is it a substitute for thoughtful analysis and synthesis. But when applied wisely, it can be a powerful investment tool.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">第二大好处是节省了时间、金钱和精力。我们无需召开冗长低效的管理会议、巴结投资者关系专员、向咨询顾问支付高昂费用，或是花数周时间构建庞大的Excel表格，而是用几小时上网下载几份报告，几分钟内就做出决策，还能提早回家陪伴家人。

应用趋同原则的若干实用方法  
关于航空业的讨论不应让人误以为，只要对特定投资情境运用趋同原则或外部视角就能万事大吉。趋同并非万能药，也不能替代缜密的分析与综合判断。但若运用得当，它将成为强大的投资工具。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">51.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">I don’t know about the rest of the world, but in India, a married person inherits their spouse’s family. Whether they like it or not. The likelihood of getting along with your spouse over the long term is relatively low if you don’t like your spouse’s first, second, and occasionally, even third cousins. For the record, my in-laws are the best.
Investing in companies is no different. Buying into a business means also buying into the industry of that business. For example, while I may think I am investing in a company that makes and sells sanitaryware, I am inheriting all the good and the bad of the sanitaryware industry. No company is an island. We can never ignore the kinds of businesses that surround it.
One of our principles of convergence investing is that if the industry allows its companies to make money consistently, we love it; if not, we better have a perfect reason for spending even one minute analyzing a business like an airline. Life is too short.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">我不清楚其他国家如何，但在印度，结婚就意味着继承配偶的家族——无论你是否情愿。如果你无法与配偶的堂表亲乃至远亲和睦相处，这段婚姻长久维系的可能性就微乎其微。需要说明的是，我的姻亲们都非常好。

投资企业也是同样的道理。投资某家公司，就意味着同时投资了它所在的行业。比如当我投资一家卫浴产品制造商时，我实际上继承了整个卫浴行业的好坏两面。没有企业是孤岛，我们永远不能忽视它所处的商业生态。

我们的聚合投资原则之一就是：如果某个行业能让企业持续盈利，我们就青睐它；反之，除非有极其充分的理由，否则我们连一分钟都不该浪费在类似航空业这样的行业分析上。毕竟人生苦短。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">52.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">There are three potential answers to the question of an industry’s attractiveness and profitability. First is that the companies in the industry struggle to keep their heads above water, just as we saw in the case of airlines. Industries like telecom towers, garment manufacturing, and commodity chemicals are notorious value destroyers. Most companies in these industries barely earn their cost of capital. As I have said repeatedly, one of the immensely underappreciated values of any strategy—including an investment strategy—is what it advises us not to do. The principle of convergence demands that I avoid investing in these industries. If most companies in the industry can’t hack it, why should I believe that this company is unique?</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">关于行业吸引力与盈利潜力的问题，存在三种可能的答案。首先，正如航空业所示，行业内企业往往艰难求生。电信铁塔、服装制造和大宗化学品等行业是公认的价值毁灭者，这些领域的大多数企业勉强达到资本回报率。我曾多次强调，任何战略（包括投资战略）最被低估的价值之一，就是它告诉我们应当规避什么。趋同原则要求我远离这些行业——如果业内多数企业都难以生存，凭什么相信某家公司能独善其身？</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">53.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">The second conclusion could be that the industry is uniformly attractive for its participants. For example, companies like Accenture, Cognizant, Infosys, and TCS in the information technology (IT) outsourcing industry earn more than 40 to 50 percent ROCE and have been doing so for decades. If you accept convergence investing as we do, you should love assessing companies in the IT industry. For example, when we evaluated an investment in Mindtree, India’s leading midtier IT services business, we knew that the company had been very profitable for many years. But how could we be sure that it would continue to be successful? By witnessing the convergent outcomes of other businesses in the industry, all of which had been able to scale their revenues over many decades without sacrificing profitability. In other words, it happened there, so all else being equal, there was a high probability that it could happen here.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">第二种可能的结论是：该行业对所有参与者都具有同等的吸引力。以信息技术（IT）外包行业为例，埃森哲、高知特、印孚瑟斯和塔塔咨询等公司的资本回报率（ROCE）持续数十年保持在40%至50%以上。若您与我们一样认同趋同投资理念，您会乐于评估IT行业的企业。例如在评估印度领先的中型IT服务公司明树科技时，我们虽知其多年保持高盈利，但如何确信其成功将持续？答案在于观察该行业其他企业的趋同结果——所有企业都在数十年间实现了收入规模化增长，同时未牺牲盈利能力。换言之，既然同行皆能实现，那么在同等条件下，该企业极有可能复制这一成功轨迹。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">54.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">My optimistic view does not mean that I will invest in any company in the IT services industry. Instead, my actual investment will depend on factors like valuation, financial risk, management track record, capital allocation, customer concentration, market share, and so on. But the companies in this industry would be right on top of my radar as Mindtree was.
You may think these industries that churn money spinners would be rare—at least that is what microeconomic theory would espouse. But they aren’t. Our portfolio is full of companies in desirable industries: enzymes, paints, cookers, business process outsourcing, bearings, compressors, consumer electricals, sanitaryware, and steam turbines, to name just a few.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">我的乐观看法并不意味着我会投资IT服务行业的任何公司。实际上，我的投资决策将取决于估值、财务风险、管理层履历、资本配置、客户集中度、市场份额等诸多因素。但这个行业的企业会像Mindtree一样，始终在我的重点关注名单上。

你或许认为这类持续创造高利润的行业凤毛麟角——至少微观经济学理论会这样主张。但事实并非如此。我们的投资组合中遍布身处优质行业的企业：酶制剂、涂料、炊具、业务流程外包、轴承、压缩机、家用电器、卫浴洁具、蒸汽轮机等，仅举数例。</div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">55.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Last, convergence can inform us that only some companies make money in specific industries, whereas most others don’t. For example, walking along Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, I am dazzled by the brilliance and splendor of fashion stores. But fashion is a brutal place to be in—very few companies grow revenues and profits steadily. Most are shooting stars that shine for a few moments and then disappear into oblivion. The same is true for retailers and restaurants. These are the trickiest companies for us to assess. Should we bet on a single business in an unattractive industry, or should we just walk away? If we evaluate a company in these industries, which we rarely do, we are exceptionally demanding—we will not invest in anyone but the undisputed leader.
We use the principle of convergence across many other areas of business apart from assessing industry attractiveness. We use it much more often to figure out what not to do.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">最后，收敛性分析能揭示某些行业中仅有少数公司盈利、多数企业亏损的现象。漫步在曼哈顿第五大道时，璀璨夺目的时装店令人目眩神迷。但时尚行业实则残酷——能持续增长营收和利润的企业凤毛麟角，多数品牌如流星般转瞬即逝。零售与餐饮业亦是如此，这些领域的企业评估最为棘手：我们该押注于缺乏吸引力的行业中的个别企业，还是直接避而远之？即便极少数情况下评估这类企业，我们的标准也极为严苛——只投资无可争议的行业霸主。

除行业吸引力评估外，我们将收敛性原则广泛应用于商业决策的其他领域，更常借此判断应规避哪些投资方向。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">I want to take you back to chapter 1, which focused exclusively on the importance of avoiding significant risks. I contended that avoiding risky investments is more important and more difficult for most investors than making good investments.
As a quick reminder, I highlighted six types of businesses we avoid at all costs:
1. Those owned and run by crooks
2. Turnaround situations
3. Those with high levels of debt
4. M&A junkies
5. Those in fast-changing industries
6. Those with unaligned owners
How did I arrive at this list? Through a combination of reliving bad experiences (1, 2, and 5), doing some factual data analysis (4, 5, and 6), watching others stumble (2, 3, and 6), and learning from owners of portfolio companies (4 and 5). The common thread through all of these was the hunger for detecting patterns and seeking a convergence of outcomes.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">让我们回到第一章，该章节着重阐述了规避重大风险的重要性。我认为，对大多数投资者而言，避开高风险投资比选择优质投资更为关键，也更具挑战性。

简单回顾一下，我特别强调了六类我们坚决回避的企业：
1. 由骗子掌控经营的企业  
2. 处于转型困境的企业  
3. 负债率过高的企业  
4. 并购成瘾的企业  
5. 身处快速变化行业的企业  
6. 所有者利益不统一的企业  

这份清单从何而来？它源于多重维度的验证：重温失败教训（第1、2、5类），数据分析佐证（第4、5、6类），观察他人失误（第2、3、6类），以及向投资组合企业所有者取经（第4、5类）。贯穿始终的核心，是对规律识别与结果趋同的执着追寻。</div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">57.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Investors can detect (or manufacture) a vast range of patterns across businesses. This is not the place to discuss all of them. Instead, this chapter intends to make the simple claim that one of the most important questions an investor can ask is, “Where else has this worked?” Before moving on, let me discuss one more aspect of convergence investing that (I think) has been critical to our success.
We are price sensitive. The median trailing price/earnings (PE) ratio for our portfolio at the time of our investment is less than 15 when the Indian market has been about 19 to 20. We have rarely ever paid more than twenty times trailing PE. Most importantly, we have never said, “This is such a great business that even 30 PE is justified.”</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">投资者能够从各类企业中发现（或人为制造）大量模式，此处无需逐一讨论。本章旨在阐明一个简单却至关重要的投资原则：投资人最应追问的问题是"这个模式在别处成功过吗？"。在继续探讨之前，请容我补充一个我认为对投资成功至关重要的趋同投资要素——我们对价格极度敏感。当印度市场市盈率中位数处于19-20倍时，我们投资组合的过往市盈率中位数始终控制在15倍以下，极少支付超过20倍市盈率的对价。最关键的是，我们从不认为"企业足够优质就能合理化30倍市盈率的估值"。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">58.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">As I have made clear in previous chapters, we have no interest in investing in low-quality or mediocre businesses at any price. Our portfolio companies are truly stellar based on verifiable empirical data on historical financials, industry market share, balance sheet quality, and customer satisfaction. Moreover, the markets are generally quite efficient—businesses like these are rarely available at a throwaway price. Since we have chosen to invest exclusively in world-class businesses, we have two options:
1. Invest at a high valuation hoping that the price will rise further, or
2. Stay inactive for long periods until we get the price we want.
We have always chosen option two. Why? Convergence. Valuation matters for equity returns over the long run across years, countries, and the size of companies. The lower the valuation, the higher the prospective long-term returns. It has worked everywhere over very long periods, so who are we to defy it?</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">正如我在前几章明确指出的，我们绝不投资低质量或平庸的企业——无论价格多么低廉。我们的投资组合企业都是真正的佼佼者，其筛选依据是可验证的历史财务数据、行业市场份额、资产负债表质量及客户满意度等实证指标。况且市场通常高度有效——这类优质企业几乎不可能以白菜价购得。由于我们坚持只投资世界级企业，因此只有两种选择：
1. 以高估值买入，期待价格继续攀升；
2. 长期保持观望，直到出现心仪价位。
我们始终选择后者。原因何在？均值回归法则。无论是跨年份、跨国界还是跨市值，估值水平对长期股权回报都具有决定性影响——估值越低，长期回报潜力越高。这一规律在漫长周期与不同地域中屡试不爽，我们岂能逆势而为？</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">There is a lot of empirical research on equity valuation and returns. The article on this topic that I like best is “Value and Growth Investing: Review and Update” by Louis K. C. Chan and Josef Lakonishok.14 I love this article for two reasons. First, it is a meta-research article that summarizes the conclusions of many other researchers over many years across several countries. Second, while Chan and Lakonishok are both academics (from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign), Lakonishok is also the CEO and chief investment officer of a $100 billion fund called LSV Asset Management. It’s always good to hear from people whose research conclusions matter to their bank balance.</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">The article has many tables with reams of data, and if you don’t have much time, I suggest focusing on table 2. It shows returns over twenty years (from 1975 to 1995) across thirteen countries for “value” stocks (those with low valuation) and “glamour” stocks (those with high valuation) across four valuation measures. The results are stark. The value portfolio beats the glamour portfolio across almost all countries. And the outperformance is not trivial: It ranges from 1.5 percentage points for Switzerland to 6.7 percentage points for the United States (based on PE ratio as the valuation measure).
The first paragraph of their conclusion is worth repeating in full:
A large body of empirical research indicates that value stocks, on average, earn higher returns than growth stocks. The reward to value investing is more pronounced for small-cap stocks, but it is also present in large-cap stocks. The value premium exists also in equity markets outside the United States.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">这篇文章包含大量数据表格，若时间有限，建议重点阅读表2。该表展示了1975至1995二十年间，十三个国家"价值股"（低估值股票）与"热门股"（高估值股票）在四种估值指标下的回报率对比。结果极具说服力：几乎所有国家的价值股组合表现都优于热门股组合，且优势显著——根据市盈率估值指标，瑞士市场超额收益为1.5个百分点，而美国市场高达6.7个百分点。

其结论部分的首段值得完整复述：
大量实证研究表明，价值股平均收益率高于成长股。这种价值投资回报在小盘股中更为显著，但大盘股同样存在这种现象。价值溢价效应在美国以外的股票市场同样成立。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">Why should we risk investing at high valuations when we know that the result will be poor on average? Some of you may detect a paradox here. Unlike LSV Asset Management, which relies on sophisticated quantitative analysis, we do in-depth qualitative research on industries and businesses. As a result, we know a lot about our portfolio companies and their industries. Given that we have an informed view of them, should we not be willing to pay up when the opportunity arises?
No.
Why? Because I have more respect for the convergence theme with respect to valuation and potential returns than my intellect. I wish I were more intelligent. But I am not.
We now arrive at an obvious question. Under what situations should we not apply the principle of convergence?
Not as Straightforward as It Sounds</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">既然明知高估值投资平均回报不佳，我们为何还要冒险？诸位或许察觉到此处的悖论。与依赖复杂量化分析的LSV资产管理公司不同，我们对行业和企业进行深度定性研究，因此对投资组合中的公司及其所属行业了如指掌。既然已形成专业判断，当机会来临时，我们是否就该甘愿支付溢价？

答案是否定的。

原因何在？因为在估值与潜在回报的均值回归规律面前，我对自身智识的敬畏远胜于自信。我多希望自己更聪慧些，可惜并非如此。

由此引出一个显而易见的问题：在何种情形下我们不应遵循均值回归原则？

The principle of convergence may seem intelligible (I hope) and its implementation a cinch. Sorry to disappoint you, but this seemingly easy-to-use tool generates its own set of thorny issues.
Give me a conclusion you desire, and I am reasonably confident that I would rationalize it based on the principle of convergence. A couple of anecdotes may masquerade as a pattern, one pattern can be ignored in favor of another, or one can simply resort to telling a story that seems to weave in an outside view where there is none.
If you are an investor or choose to be one, you will need to learn your lessons the hard way. However, here are some pointers based on my experience.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">一位智者——据传是爱因斯坦，但无从考证——曾说过："凡事应尽可能简化，但不宜过分简化。"生活如此复杂，投资亦然。趋同原理看似易懂（但愿如此），实践起来似乎也不费吹灰之力。但很遗憾，这个看似便捷的工具本身就会引发一系列棘手问题。

给我一个你想要的结论，我完全能运用趋同原理为其自圆其说。几则轶事可包装成规律，某个规律可被另一个替代，甚至只需编造一个看似融入外部视角的故事——尽管这种视角根本不存在。

若你已是或选择成为投资者，终将亲尝教训方能领悟。不过根据我的经验，以下几点可供参考：</div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">63.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">The probability of convergent evolution is higher in living organisms if they share similarities in genetics, development, and ecology.15 Unsurprisingly, the greater the similarity of “conditions” in businesses, the greater is the benefit of using the principle of convergence in investing. “Conditions” here could mean industry structure, geography, competitive dynamics, stage of business, the similarity of business models, and much more. For example, we saw that the Caribbean anoles were endowed with the same physical attributes when conditions were similar across the islands. Therefore, businesses should operate under the same principle.
Let me take the example of three types of businesses to explain the complications of applying the principle of convergence.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">若生物体在遗传、发育和生态方面具有相似性，趋同进化的概率就会更高。15 同理，企业间的"条件"越相似，运用趋同原则进行投资的益处就越大。此处的"条件"可指行业结构、地域分布、竞争态势、发展阶段、商业模式的相似性等诸多因素。例如我们看到，当加勒比群岛的生态环境相似时，岛上的安乐蜥便进化出相同的身体特征。因此，企业经营也应遵循相同原理。

我以三类企业为例，说明应用趋同原则的复杂性。</div>

            <div class="text-block simplified-text">以一家生产工业机器人的德国公司为例。这些机器人销往全球各地的制造企业。由于这是一项全球性业务，我不会过分关注其中的德国因素，而是会研究世界各地（无论位于中国、意大利还是新加坡）提供相同或类似设备的企业，了解它们的增长情况、盈利能力以及市场份额的变化趋势。我还会将分析层面"上移"一级，考察全球范围内提供精密工业机械企业的表现。虽然对第二层分析的重视程度可能较低，但我会通过研究来识别其中可能存在的明显趋势。

或许有人会认为，我过于草率地否定了德国工程企业的整体价值——德国工程优势中的某些特质或许能为工业机器人业务提供范本。对此我持怀疑态度，但你们的观点可能有道理。既然如此，不妨亲自展开研究验证。</div>

Should we use convergent investing by assessing the economics and industry structure of hospitals in the United Kingdom, Italy, and the Netherlands? Health care in most markets is heavily regulated, and this may significantly impact the economics of a hospital. It would be too cumbersome to assess the impact of local laws on the hospitals in each country. Instead, we could use a shortcut to see if the overall hospital economics—or those of the top five to ten hospitals if industry data are unavailable—are comparable across countries. Since hospitals are a services business, can we use the information from other German services sectors (say, hotels) to refine our assessment? Think about it.</div>

Industries converge toward similar fates after the companies have had enough time to plan and execute their strategies, after winners and losers have been (essentially) decided, and when the pace of change has declined. Thus, if we are exploring an investment in a paint company in Germany, it would be helpful to study the paint industry in the Western world. But if we were in the year 2000, drawing parallels from the U.S. e-commerce industry for an investment in a Chinese e-retailer may have been taking things a bit too far.
As you can see, convergence investing is not an objective, bias-free, mathematical endeavor that always yields the same answer. As a result, you may have a different view of one or more of my conclusions. And therein lies all the fun and frustration of investing.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">我们注意到传统行业（如涂料、服装、发动机、涡轮机、汽车）的趋同性较高，而新兴行业（如虚拟现实、机器人、电动汽车、生物技术）则较低。当企业有足够时间制定并执行战略、胜负格局（基本）已定、且行业变革速度放缓时，各行业会逐渐走向相似的命运。因此，若考虑投资德国涂料企业，研究西方国家的涂料行业会大有裨益。但若将2000年美国电子商务行业的情况，直接套用于对中国电子零售企业的投资决策，则未免失之偏颇。

由此可见，趋同投资并非总能得出标准答案的客观、无偏见数学行为。因此，您可能对我的一项或多项结论持有不同见解——而这正是投资既令人着迷又使人困扰的根源所在。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">This brings us back to Tim Cooper and the mysteriously turbid Ara-3 flask.
Lessons from Lenski
On February 24, 1988, Professor Richard Lenski seeded twelve sterile flasks containing ten milliliters of glucose solution with the common bacterium Escherichia coli (commonly called E. coli).
Lenski had started an experiment that continues today and has yielded hundreds of research articles, dozens of doctorates, and global acclaim.17
He started an experiment on long-term evolution like the one conducted on silver foxes by Lyudmila Trut and Dmitri Belyaev but with two key differences. First, he wanted to use microscopic organisms that have a generation time of only twenty minutes, thereby allowing tens of thousands of generations to evolve over a human lifetime. Second, unlike the artificial selection experiments on foxes (or dogs or wheat), in which the experimenter chooses who (or what) reproduces, Lenski wanted the experimental environment to choose.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">这让我们回到蒂姆·库珀那个浑浊神秘的Ara-3培养瓶。  

**伦斯基的启示**  
1988年2月24日，理查德·伦斯基教授将普通的大肠杆菌接种到十二个无菌培养瓶中，每个瓶内装有十毫升葡萄糖溶液。  

伦斯基开启了一项延续至今的实验，该实验已产出数百篇研究论文、数十个博士学位，并获得全球赞誉。这项长期进化实验与柳德米拉·特鲁特和德米特里·别利亚耶夫对银狐的研究类似，但有两点关键差异：其一，他选用繁殖周期仅二十分钟的微生物，使人类寿命范围内可观测数万代进化；其二，与狐狸（或犬类、小麦）人工选择实验不同——此类实验由研究者决定繁殖对象——伦斯基让实验环境自行筛选。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">When the experiment started, all twelve flasks had genetically the same E. coli since all cells came from the same mother cell. Each flask contained hundreds of millions of bacteria, so there was ample opportunity for mutations to emerge. An essential experimental twist was that food was in limited supply. Every day, the E. coli population increased for about six hours until the glucose was exhausted. At this point, the bacteria would stop dividing and wait. The next day, a lab member—someone like Tim Cooper—would take 0.1 milliliters out of each flask (1 percent of the flask’s content) and inoculate a new flask containing 9.9 milliliters of fresh glucose solution. A new cycle would then begin until the next day, when the same procedure would be repeated. And the next day. Week after week, month after month, year after year.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">实验开始时，十二个烧瓶中的大肠杆菌在基因层面完全相同，因为它们都来自同一个母细胞。每个烧瓶中存活着数亿细菌，因此存在充足的突变机会。这项实验的关键设计在于有限的食物供应——每天大肠杆菌群约有六小时增殖期，直至葡萄糖耗尽。此时细菌会停止分裂进入休眠状态。次日，实验室成员（例如蒂姆·库珀）会从每个烧瓶抽取0.1毫升培养液（占烧瓶容量的1%），将其接种到装有9.9毫升新鲜葡萄糖溶液的新烧瓶中。新的增殖周期由此启动，并在次日重复相同流程。日复一日，周复一周，月复一月，年复一年。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">Lenski was replaying Gould’s proverbial tape of life simultaneously in twelve flasks. He wasn’t selecting the bacteria, and he wasn’t varying the medium. Instead, he was letting life run its course in parallel over thousands of generations. What he found was remarkable. In 2011, after fifty thousand generations of evolution, he said, “To my surprise, evolution was pretty repeatable. . . . Although the lineages certainly diverged in many details, I was struck by the parallel trajectories of their evolution, with similar changes in so many phenotypic traits and even gene sequences we examined.”</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">伦斯基同时在十二个培养瓶中重演了古尔德著名的"生命磁带"实验。他既没有筛选细菌，也没有改变培养基，而是让生命在数千代平行演化中自然发展。其发现令人惊叹：2011年，在观察五万代演化后他表示："令我惊讶的是，进化过程具有惊人的可重复性......尽管各菌株在细节上存在差异，但它们展现出平行的演化轨迹——无论是表型特征还是我们检测的基因序列，都出现了相似的改变。"</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">It wasn’t that the bacteria had not evolved. On the contrary, they had evolved a lot. The E. coli in different flasks adapted differently to the starvation diet by either growing faster or becoming more numerous than earlier generations. But the general trend was unmistakable: On average, the population grew 70 percent faster than their founding ancestors. In addition, the researchers found another example of convergent evolution. All twelve populations of bacteria had lost the ability to synthesize a sugar called D-ribose because all had undergone the same set of genetic changes.
Unlike Gould’s prediction, the replaying of the tape of life was yielding the same result.
Until one day, fifteen years after the start of the experiment, Tim Cooper found that it didn’t.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">并非细菌没有进化。恰恰相反，它们进化显著。不同烧瓶中的大肠杆菌通过比前代生长更快或数量更多的方式，对饥饿饮食产生了不同的适应。但总体趋势明确无误：平均而言，这些菌群的生长速度比它们的始祖快了70%。此外，研究人员还发现了趋同进化的又一例证——所有十二组细菌种群都因经历了相同的基因变化，丧失了合成D-核糖的能力。

这与古尔德的预言不同：当生命磁带重放时，结果竟完全一致。
直到实验开始十五年后的一天，蒂姆·库珀发现情况并非如此。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">The reason the Ara-3 flask had turned opaque was that, unlike the other flasks, it had experienced a population explosion. The Ara-3 population was ten times the size of the populations in the other flasks. How could this have happened when all flasks had only a limited amount of glucose?
The Ara-3 bacteria had developed the ability to feed on some other ingredient in the solution. The only other candidate was a molecule called citrate present in all glucose solutions from day one. However, at the time of the beginning of the experiment, E. coli was explicitly known not to synthesize citrate in the presence of oxygen. Therefore, this inability was used to identify whether a type of bacteria was E. coli or not!</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">Ara-3培养瓶变浑浊的原因在于：与其他培养瓶不同，它经历了种群数量激增。Ara-3菌群的规模是其他培养瓶菌群的十倍。在所有培养瓶葡萄糖含量均有限的情况下，这种现象是如何发生的？

Ara-3菌群进化出了摄取溶液中其他成分的能力。唯一可能被利用的成分是从实验第一天起就存在于所有葡萄糖溶液中的柠檬酸盐分子。但在实验开始时，科学界已明确认定大肠杆菌无法在含氧环境中合成柠檬酸盐——这项特征甚至被用作鉴别某种细菌是否属于大肠杆菌的依据！</div>

It was as big a case of divergence as biology had ever seen experimentally. Lenski’s lab later found that the ability of the Ara-3 bacteria to digest citrate resulted from a series of mutations after about twenty thousand generations. Unfortunately, each mutation was rare, so no bacteria in any of the other flasks have developed this ability.
It is worth paying attention to the two critical lessons from Lenski’s long-term experiment:
1. Convergence is the dominant pattern in the natural world.
2. On rare occasions, it isn’t.
We can replace just one word to derive the same two critical lessons for us investors:

这项长期实验为我们揭示了两条重要启示：
1. 趋同是自然界的主流规律
2. 偶尔也会出现例外

Of course, there are only a few ways for businesses to succeed. As investors, identifying a convergent pattern of success or failure has helped us make (what we think are) some excellent investments and avoid many bad ones.
But I have also reached a painful realization that patterns can break, and a successful Ara-3-type mutant can arise occasionally. Unfortunately, we would miss an opportunity to invest in it.
If one replays the tape of business history across periods and countries, the overwhelming convergent pattern would be that business focus leads to success. Most of our portfolio comprises businesses with only one product or service or a small set of related products and services. We refuse to invest in diversified companies or conglomerates. We also express disappointment when any of our management teams try to deviate from their course.</div>

但我也痛苦地意识到，模式可能被打破——偶尔会出现阿拉-3型突变体这样的成功特例。遗憾的是，我们往往会错过投资这类特例的机会。

倘若重放不同时期、不同国家的商业史录像，最显著的趋同模式莫过于专注带来成功。我们投资组合中的企业，大多只提供单一产品或服务，或少量关联产品服务。我们拒绝投资业务分散的公司或集团企业，当管理层试图偏离既定轨道时，我们也会明确表达失望。</div>

Chapter Summary
Evolutionary theory has taught me that . . .
. . . an important element of reimagining investing is internalizing the recurring patterns of success and failure in the business world.
1. Convergence—unrelated organisms developing the same solutions to similar problems—is ubiquitous in nature. It is seen across animals, plants, fungi, and even bacteria. In nature, every problem seems to have only a small set of solutions.
2. For example, Australia’s flora and fauna has been evolving independently of those of the rest of the world for more than thirty-five million years (when Australia became a separate continent), but for every Australian marsupial, there seems to be a placental counterpart.</div>

章节总结  
进化论教会我……  
……重新构想投资的一个重要元素，就是理解商界成功与失败反复出现的模式。  

1. 趋同进化——无关生物对相似问题发展出相同解决方案——在自然界无处不在。这种现象见于动物、植物、真菌甚至细菌。在自然界中，每个问题似乎都只有少数几种解决方案。  
2. 例如，澳大利亚的动植物已独立于世界其他地区进化了三千五百万年（自澳大利亚成为独立大陆以来），但每一种澳大利亚有袋类动物，似乎都能找到对应的胎盘类动物。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">3. The business world, too, is convergent. There are definitive patterns to the success and failure of companies. We exploit this property of the corporate world to select outstanding businesses and reject lousy ones by asking a simple question: “Where else have we seen this?”
4. We are investors not in individual businesses but in proven and successful templates of businesses.
5. We are big fans of Daniel Kahneman’s “outside view”—which is conceptually similar to convergence and compels us to seek similar patterns elsewhere before making an investment decision.
6. However, applying the principle of convergence is tricky because we humans can see patterns where none exist. We can also miss out on one-off opportunities like Amazon that seem to defy the convergent notion that focus is the key to success.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">3. 商业世界同样具有趋同性。企业的成败存在明确规律。我们利用企业界的这一特性，通过提出一个简单问题来筛选卓越企业、淘汰劣质公司："我们还在哪些地方见过这种模式？"

4. 我们投资的不是单个企业，而是经过验证的成功商业模式模板。

5. 我们极为推崇丹尼尔·卡尼曼提出的"外部视角"——其概念与趋同性原理相似，要求我们在投资决策前必须寻找其他领域的相似模式。

6. 然而应用趋同性原理需要技巧，因为人类常会虚构出并不存在的规律。我们也可能错失像亚马逊这样的特例——它似乎颠覆了"专注是成功关键"这一趋同认知。</div>
