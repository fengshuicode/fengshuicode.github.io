            <div class="text-block original-text">The Perils of a Pavlovian
As many more individuals of each species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, there is a frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, will have a better chance of surviving, and thus be naturally selected.
Charles Darwin, On the Origin of Species, introduction
In our view, it is folly to forgo buying shares in an outstanding business whose long-term future is predictable, because of short-term worries about an economy or a stock market that we know to be unpredictable. Why scrap an informed decision because of an uninformed guess?
Warren Buffett, annual letter to shareholders, 1994
You are going bald. Not because of age, but because you have been tearing your hair out.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">巴甫洛夫式陷阱  
由于每一物种诞生的个体数量远超其可能存活的数量，因而持续存在着频繁的生存竞争。由此可知，任何生物只要在复杂多变的生活环境中发生对自身有利的细微变异，便更有可能存活下来，从而被自然选择所保留。  
——查尔斯·达尔文《物种起源》导论  

我们认为，仅仅因为对难以预测的经济或股市存在短期忧虑，就放弃买入长期前景可期的卓越企业股票，实属愚行。岂能因无依据的猜测而推翻深思熟虑的决策？

            <div class="text-block original-text">A few months ago, you committed to investing $100,000 with a money manager. This fund manager did not want to raise cash and said that he would call commitments if he saw attractive opportunities to invest in the market. He made a strong pitch with a snazzy PowerPoint presentation, and, like everyone in the industry, he promised to be long-term oriented. He also claimed that he does not like to lose money (as if everyone else does!) and that he carefully assesses the quality of businesses and buys when everyone else is selling. Very Buffettesque. Very old world. You have heard the same spiel from everyone, but he seems quite sincere. Or at least he put on a good act.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">数月前，你承诺向一位基金经理投资10万美元。这位经理不愿持有现金，声称发现市场出现诱人投资机会时才会调用资金。他用花哨的PPT做了精彩推介，与业内同行如出一辙地承诺坚持长期投资理念。他还宣称自己厌恶亏损（仿佛其他人就喜欢似的），强调会审慎评估企业质量并在众人抛售时买入——十足的巴菲特风格，十足的传统做派。这类说辞你早已耳熟能详，但他显得尤为诚恳。至少，他的表演堪称完美。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">A few quarters have passed, and he has called $40,000 from you. At the end of the quarter, the value of your $40,000 investment is $38,000. You know that the market has been a bit weak lately, so you ignore the minor loss. You are a patient sort and don’t fret over the value of your investments daily like many of your friends.
But when you check your investments next quarter, you see that the value of your portfolio is now only $32,000. You have taken a hit of 15 percent in a single quarter. To rub salt into your wounds, the fund manager demands $15,000 more from you. He is entitled to; you have signed an agreement with him that commits you to keep investing until your $100,000 limit is reached. You invest the additional $15,000.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">几个季度过去，他已从你这里调用了4万美元。季度末时，你这笔4万美元的投资市值跌至3.8万美元。你知道近期市场有些疲软，因此对这微小亏损不以为意。你是个有耐心的人，不像许多朋友那样每天为投资净值焦虑。  
然而当下个季度查看投资时，你发现组合价值已缩水至3.2万美元。单季度竟亏损了15%。更雪上加霜的是，基金经理要求你追加1.5万美元注资。他确实有权这样做——你签署的协议中承诺会持续投资直至10万美元额度用尽。你只得再次投入这1.5万美元。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">4.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">One more quarter goes by, and you are aghast to discover that the value of your $55,000 is now only $39,000. You are down 30 percent within six months! The fund manager repeats the same mantra, “We are long term, patient, blah . . . blah  . . . blah,” while asking for an additional $15,000! You talk to some of your friends who appear to be stock market experts. All of them advise you to stop investing more and to withdraw your remaining capital promptly. Unfortunately, your lawyer advises you that there is no way out. Not only can you not redeem your capital (because you have agreed to a lock-up for many years), but you must honor your commitment. With great reluctance, you invest an additional $15,000. Your total investment is now $70,000.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">又过了一个季度，你惊恐地发现当初的5.5万美元投资如今只剩3.9万。短短六个月竟亏损30%！基金经理重复着那套陈词滥调："我们坚持长期价值投资，需要耐心......"同时竟要求你追加1.5万美元注资。你咨询了几位自称股市专家的朋友，他们全都建议立即停止注资并尽快撤出剩余本金。可律师的答复却雪上加霜——不仅因多年锁定期协议无法赎回本金，你还必须履行注资承诺。最终你极不情愿地追加了1.5万美元投资，累计投入金额至此达到7万美元。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">You have read Buffett’s great annual letters and listened to his interviews on TV. You remember that he advises investors not to check their stock holdings obsessively. Hence, this time, you decide to wait six months before reviewing how your portfolio has performed. Kudos for your patience!
The day finally arrives. You haven’t felt this nervous since the first time you used a fake ID to enter a bar. You open your account statement with increasing dread. Your worst fears are realized. Your $70,000 investment has now almost halved to $36,000. Your portfolio has lost about 40 percent during the past six months. Oh, and your money manager is threatening to ask for more money.
Apart from continuing to tear at your remaining hair, what should you do?
The horns of dung beetles. Maybe they have the answer.
The How Versus the Why</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">你读过巴菲特精彩的年度股东信，也看过他在电视上的访谈。记得他曾建议投资者不要过分关注股票持仓。于是这次，你决定等上六个月再查看投资组合的表现。这份耐心值得称赞！

终于到了这一天。自打第一次用假身份证混进酒吧后，你还没这么紧张过。你颤抖着打开账户对账单，恐惧不断加剧——最坏的担忧成真了。七万美元的投资如今几乎腰斩至三万六千美元，过去半年你的投资组合缩水了约40%。更糟的是，你的理财经理正暗示要追加资金。

除了继续揪所剩无几的头发，你还能怎么办？

或许粪金龟的犄角里藏着答案。

关键在于"如何"而非"为何"。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">Dung beetles love poop. Duh. With about eight thousand species, this cleanup crew of the insect world eats poop. They build their nests with poop, live in those nests, and lay their eggs in them to sustain their larvae.1 Check out figure 4.1 for a small sample of the astonishing variety of dung beetles. Among insects, they have the unique distinction of caring for their young: dad provides food, and mom tends to the nest.

            <div class="text-block original-text">Many years ago, while taking a poop in the open in Masai Mara in Kenya (don’t ask), I heard them before I saw them. They scurry noisily at a surprisingly brisk pace. The males have impressive-looking horns, and the eight thousand species have almost as many different kinds of horns. Their shape resembles rhinoceros horns, elephant tusks, deer antlers, and even a serrated knife; their size varies from very small to massive. Some are even larger than the entire dung beetle’s body.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">多年前在肯尼亚马赛马拉露天解手时（别问），我先闻其声后见其形。它们行动迅捷，窸窣作响。雄性甲虫顶着威风凛凛的犄角，八千个物种的角器形态几乎同样繁多——有的似犀角，有的如象牙，有的类鹿茸，甚至还有锯齿刀般的；尺寸从小若米粒到大如磐石不等，某些犄角甚至比蜣螂整个身躯还要庞大。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">8.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">What explains these horns? One way evolutionary biologists describe them is through hormonal, developmental, and genetic mechanisms. For example, a 2019 Science article provides evidence that dung beetles use wing genes to grow their horns.2 The wing genes get turned on in the early stages of the growth of the horns. Later, these genes switch off, and a new set of genes grows and shapes the horns. An article in the Journal of Insect Physiology explores the types and quantities of hormones that control the length of horns in males.3 It showed that the hormone methoprene has a significant influence on the production of horns. These scientists are asking “how” questions. How do the horns grow? How does horn length differ?</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">这些犄角因何而生？进化生物学家从激素、发育和遗传机制的角度给出了一种解释。例如《科学》杂志2019年一篇论文证实，蜣螂利用翅膀基因来培育犄角——在犄角生长初期，翅膀基因被激活；后期这些基因关闭后，另一组基因便开始主导犄角的成型与塑造。《昆虫生理学杂志》有研究则探究了调控雄性犄角长度的激素类型与剂量，发现烯虫酯激素对犄角生成具有显著影响。这些科学家聚焦的是"如何"类问题：犄角如何生长？长度差异如何形成？</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">9.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Another route of exploring the cause of horns is to understand the adaptive nature of them. These are “why” questions: Why did horns arise? Why do they increase the fitness of the beetle? Why can horns be considered an adaptation? The selectionist explanation contends that the horns of male dung beetles allow the bearer to garner more resources, defend their nests, and compete for the best females, thereby reproducing more than the males without horns. For example, an article in the Journal of Insect Behavior describes an experiment providing evidence that males with larger horns get preferential access to females and thus can be considered adaptive. The same article also describes the adaptive value of small horns in some males. These males have greater mobility and can sneak around the larger males to mate with the females!</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">探究犄角成因的另一条路径，是理解其适应性本质。这类问题聚焦"为何"：为何会产生犄角？为何犄角能增强蜣螂的适应度？为何犄角可被视为适应性特征？选择主义理论认为，雄性蜣螂的犄角使其能够获取更多资源、保卫巢穴并与同类竞争优质雌性，从而使有角雄性比无角个体获得更多繁殖机会。《昆虫行为学杂志》的一篇论文记载了相关实验，证明拥有较大犄角的雄性确实能优先接触雌性，这印证了犄角的适应性价值。该研究同时揭示了小型犄角的适应性优势——这类雄性个体机动性更强，可绕过大型雄性暗中与雌性交配。</div>

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">10.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">The first category of explanations for the dung beetle’s horns—addressing the “how” question—are called proximate causes, and the second—addressing the “why” question—are ultimate causes. Proximate mechanisms explore immediate, physical influences on a trait. The history of the organism determines ultimate causes, specifically the role played by natural selection to favor one trait versus another.
To elaborate further, let’s talk about sex.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">关于蜣螂犄角的第一类解释——回答"如何"的问题——被称为近因；第二类解释——回答"为何"的问题——则称为远因。近因机制探讨的是影响特征的直接物理因素。而远因则取决于生物体的演化历程，具体而言是自然选择对特定特征的偏好作用。

            <div class="text-block original-text">Or more precisely, polyandry in the predatory mite species Neoseiulus californicus.4 Polyandry implies multiple matings by the female of a species and is the opposite of polygyny, wherein a male succeeds in mating with multiple females. Bateman’s principle, named after an English geneticist, argues for the prevalence of polygyny in the animal kingdom. He contended that since females invest much more in offspring than do males, they are the limiting factor over which males compete, leading to polygyny. However, polyandry is more widespread than Bateman believed; in many species, females are not just waiting around to get impregnated—they are actively scouting for multiple partners. And one of these species is the mite N. californicus.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">更准确地说，这种现象存在于捕食性螨虫加州新小绥螨中。一妻多夫制指同一雌性与多个雄性交配，与一夫多妻制恰好相反——后者指单个雄性成功与多个雌性交配。以英国遗传学家命名的贝特曼原则认为，动物界普遍存在一夫多妻现象。他主张由于雌性对后代的投入远高于雄性，雌性成为雄性争夺的稀缺资源，从而导致一夫多妻制。但一妻多夫制的普遍性远超贝特曼的设想：许多物种中，雌性并非被动等待受孕，而是主动寻求多个配偶。加州新小绥螨正是这样的物种之一。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">But what drives this mite to become polyandrous when the dominant trend in the animal world is toward polygyny? Peter Schausberger and his colleagues tackled this question in a PLoS One article, and they came up with two different sets of explanations: one “proximate” and one “ultimate.”
The scientists discovered that the ultimate cause of polyandry in N. californicus consists of both direct and indirect fitness benefits. Females that mated multiple times produced more offspring than females that mated just once, and these offspring also survived longer. As for the proximate cause, the authors identified a key one: first mating duration. If the females’ first mating period was below a certain threshold (150 minutes), the likelihood of their continuing to seek male partners increased. The immediate cause of females seeking more sex was a lack of sex. Who says science is boring?</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">但究竟是什么驱使这种螨虫在动物界普遍倾向一雄多雌制时，却选择了一雌多雄制？彼得·绍斯伯格及其同事在《公共科学图书馆·综合》期刊发表的论文中探讨了这个问题，并提出了两套不同的解释：其一是"直接原因"，其二是"根本原因"。

科学家们发现加州新小绥螨实行一雌多雄制的根本原因，在于直接与间接的适应效益双重作用。多次交配的雌螨比仅交配一次的产卵量更高，且后代存活时间更长。至于直接原因，研究者锁定了一个关键因素：首次交配时长。当雌螨首次交配时间不足特定阈值（150分钟）时，它们继续寻找雄性伴侣的概率就会上升。雌螨寻求更多交配的直接原因竟是交配不足。谁说科学枯燥无趣呢？</div>

First, an ecological cause: The bird would starve if it stayed in New Hampshire for the winter. Second, a genetic cause honed over millions of years that induced the warbler to respond to external stimuli and gain selective advantage over warblers that did not migrate. Third, an internal physiological cause that propelled the bird to leave once the number of daylight hours dropped below a certain level. And last, an external physiological cause that was reflected in a sudden drop in temperature on August 25. The warbler was already physiologically ready for migration, and this sudden cold wave made it leave that day. Mayr called the first two explanations ultimate causes and the latter two proximate causes.

We want the businesses we own to increase in value over the long run. And the only way for this to happen is for the company to perform well over many years, preferably decades. Investment success may not correlate with business success for a day trader or short-term investor. But for us, the ultimate success of an investment is almost entirely dependent on the ultimate success of the business.
If you accept this premise, then as permanent owners, we should focus exclusively on the quality and performance of the business over the long run. And that is what we do.</div>

And all are divorced from what could ultimately lead to the business success or failure—and hence a higher or lower market value—of a company. The question we investors don’t ask often enough but should is relatively straightforward: Does this proximate cause have anything to do with the cause of ultimate business success?
The interesting thing about proximate causes is that they are almost always evident in screaming newspaper headlines and hyperventilating news anchors. Ultimate causes, thankfully, are way too dull for media coverage. Why “thankfully”? I will get to it.
The sections that follow describe four categories of proximate causes of share price gyrations: macroeconomic, market-related, thematic, and company-specific factors.

For the first time in its history, the New York Stock Exchange halted trading. All major world markets were affected: Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 6 percent, the United Kingdom’s FTSE fell 6 percent, the Australian market fell 7 percent, and Germany’s DAX fell almost 6 percent. In short, if you were looking for a definition of financial panic, your search would have ended here.
The proximate cause of this mayhem? The spreading of the Asian financial crisis.6 It had all started on July 2, 1997, when the Thai government floated the baht since it did not have the foreign currency to support the baht’s peg to the U.S. dollar. The currencies of Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia, and the Philippines also suffered precipitous declines. Many companies in these countries had borrowings in dollars, and these firms started defaulting on their payments.</div>

这场混乱的直接诱因？亚洲金融危机的蔓延。危机始于1997年7月2日，泰国政府因外汇储备不足维持泰铢与美元挂钩，被迫实行浮动汇率制。随后印尼、韩国、马来西亚和菲律宾等国货币相继暴跌。这些国家众多企业背负美元债务，开始出现大规模违约潮。</div>

Proximate paranoia confused with ultimate reality.
The evidence is in the second column, which provides the index levels and stock prices six months after October 27, 1997. The Dow, as well as the FTSE, were up 25 percent, and the dramatic upward movement of companies like Wal-Mart, Diageo, and Unilever may have led to the firing of some fund managers who had pressed the panic button on October 27.</div>

人们将短期恐慌误认为终极现实。

But please don’t blame us for being inconsistent. Whenever the markets get excited about a macroeconomic event, the fund managers behave predictably by riding the proximate bandwagon of stock prices.

Fund managers have a Pavlovian reaction to macro or market data. Will interest rates be higher? Sell. Will inflation be lower? Buy. If the fiscal deficit shoots up? Sell. Or is it a buy?

            <div class="text-block original-text">Some argue that for certain types of businesses—say, banks or financial companies that rely on lending and deposit-taking—interest rates should significantly impact long-term performance. Hence, interest rate movements should be proximate and ultimate causes of business performance. Let’s look at the following data of stock price changes for three large Indian banks over twenty years from December 31, 1999, to December 31, 2019:
HDFC Bank81x
ICICI Bank33x
State Bank of India16x
During these two decades, the Reserve Bank of India had increased or decreased interest rates more than fifty times.7 Rates varied between 5 percent and 12 percent, with wild gyrations in between. More importantly, all these banks were subject to the same regime of interest rates and other macro factors. If you were an HDFC Bank shareholder, did it matter what the interest rate was, or at what pace the Reserve Bank of India changed it?</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">有人认为，对于某些特定行业——比如依赖存贷款业务的银行或金融公司——利率应对长期业绩产生重大影响。因此，利率变动应是企业表现的直接和根本原因。让我们看看以下三家印度大型银行在1999年12月31日至2019年12月31日这二十年间股价变动的数据：
HDFC银行81倍  
ICICI银行33倍  
印度国家银行16倍  
这二十年间，印度储备银行调整利率超过五十次。利率在5%至12%之间剧烈波动。更重要的是，所有这些银行都处于相同的利率政策和其他宏观因素环境下。如果您是HDFC银行的股东，印度储备银行的利率水平或调整节奏真的重要吗？</div>

In October 2020, The Economist called him the best banker in the world.8 Interest rates, current account deficits, exchange rates, and other such esoteric measures did not get in the way of Puri achieving excellence.
I am not cherry-picking here. Over the long run, well-run businesses create a lot of value irrespective of the macroeconomic environment. Do we seriously think Amazon, JPMorgan, Michelin, Nestlé, Siemens, Tesco, Walmart, Zara, and other excellent businesses are held hostage to inflation and fiscal deficit? If the business and stock price performance of exceptional companies is immune to macroeconomic perturbations, aren’t we, as investors in those companies, better off ignoring the economy?</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">印度HDFC银行的业务及其股价表现卓越，这要归功于其首席执行官阿迪亚·普里——这位印度企业史上最杰出的领导者之一。2020年10月，《经济学人》称他为全球最佳银行家。无论是利率、经常账户赤字、汇率还是其他晦涩的经济指标，都未能阻碍普里缔造卓越。

我并非在此刻意筛选案例。长期来看，管理良好的企业总能在任何宏观经济环境下创造巨大价值。难道真有人认为亚马逊、摩根大通、米其林、雀巢、西门子、乐购、沃尔玛、Zara等卓越企业会被通货膨胀和财政赤字所挟持？既然杰出企业的经营业绩与股价表现能够抵御宏观经济波动，那么我们作为这些企业的投资者，是否更应忽略经济大势？</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">There is another big problem with considering macroeconomic data while analyzing individual businesses. Let’s confront this headache through the example of tires. There are many listed tire businesses in India, so it should be a happy hunting ground for us. Let’s say the World Bank announces that India will grow its GDP by 8 percent next year. This seems like good news for the country. What about tires? Someone could argue that GDP growth will lead to an increase in personal wealth, which would lead to consumers buying more cars, and hence more tires.
Should we buy a tire business then? But wait. A sales increase is not the same as a profit increase. The primary raw material for tire companies is rubber, which accounts for about 60 percent of revenue. What if rubber prices shoot up in anticipation that Indian tire businesses will need to buy more rubber next year? This is getting way too complicated. You need a number-crunching analyst with a lot of computing power at their disposal.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">在分析个别企业时参考宏观经济数据还存在另一个严重问题。让我们通过轮胎行业的例子来剖析这个令人头疼的问题。印度有许多上市轮胎企业，本应是我们大展身手的领域。假设世界银行宣布印度明年GDP将增长8%，这对国家似乎是利好消息。那么轮胎行业呢？有人可能认为GDP增长会提升个人财富，促使消费者购买更多汽车，从而带动轮胎需求。

这是否意味着我们应该投资轮胎企业？且慢。销售额增长并不等同于利润增长。轮胎企业的主要原材料是橡胶，约占营收的60%。如果市场预期印度轮胎企业明年将增加橡胶采购而导致橡胶价格暴涨呢？情况正变得过于复杂。此时你需要一个拥有强大计算能力的专业分析师来 crunch the numbers（进行数据测算）。</div>

How can we assess all these factors in the context of a tire business? And fund managers don’t invest only in tires.

            <div class="text-block simplified-text">我可以一直列举下去。但情况会变得更糟（或者更好，如果你正是那位拿着加班费的聪明分析师的话）。请注意，在轮胎案例中，我仅通过分析GDP增长来预测企业业绩。但宏观经济数据涵盖的指标范围要广泛得多，比如就业水平、汇率、通货膨胀、政府赤字、货币供应量、经常账户余额等等。我们该如何结合轮胎业务来评估所有这些因素？而且基金经理的投资对象可不只有轮胎。难道我们要对追踪的数十个行业、数百家企业都重复这种庞大的分析工程吗？此外，考虑到全球经济的互联性，我们是否还应该将其他国家的宏观经济数据纳入决策考量？

            <div class="text-block original-text">We have seen two problems with treating macroeconomic factors as critical proximate variables. First, we noticed that even big macro events (like the Asian financial crisis) are uncorrelated with longer-term stock price performance. Second, taking the example of the Indian tire industry, we concluded that using proximate economic data to assess industry and company performance is very hard, if not impossible.
The third problem with using economic data is the most obvious of all. No one knows anything. Okay, that is exaggerating a bit. But only a bit. Since even expert economists are abysmal at forecasting the economy, why should we investors squander our time giving it any importance?</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">我们发现将宏观经济因素视为关键直接变量存在两个问题。首先，我们注意到即便是重大宏观事件（如亚洲金融危机）也与股票价格的长期表现无关。其次，以印度轮胎行业为例，我们得出结论：利用直接经济数据来评估行业和公司表现即便不是完全不可能，也是极其困难的。

使用经济数据的第三个问题最为显而易见——没有人能预知未来。好吧，这么说或许有些夸张，但也仅有一点点夸张。既然连专业经济学家对经济走势的预测都糟糕透顶，我们投资者又何必浪费时间过分重视这些数据呢？</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">I assume you will agree that an economist’s most important task is to forecast a recession. This would enable the government to take the necessary steps to prevent widespread pain and suffering. In March 2018, the IMF published a working paper titled “How Well Do Economists Forecast Recessions?”9 The authors compared real GDP forecasts with actual growth data for sixty-three countries from 1992 to 2014. They showed that while GDP contracted by an average of 2.8 percentage points during recessions, the consensus forecast from the year before the recession was a growth of 3 percent! Worse, even during the year of the recession, the average forecast was a contraction of 0.8 percent when the real contraction turned out to be 2.8 percent.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">我认为你会认同，经济学家最重要的任务是预测经济衰退。这能让政府采取必要措施，避免大范围的痛苦与困境。2018年3月，国际货币基金组织发布题为《经济学家预测经济衰退的能力有多强？》的工作论文。研究者对比了1992至2014年间63个国家的实际GDP预测值与真实增长数据。结果显示：尽管经济衰退期间GDP平均萎缩2.8个百分点，但衰退前一年的普遍预测却是增长3%！更糟的是，即便在衰退当年，当实际萎缩幅度达2.8%时，平均预测值仍仅为萎缩0.8%。</div>

One would have thought that with a greater volume of data, more computing power, and better algorithms, our ability to forecast would have improved over the years. Yeah, right. In the same Guardian article, Mark Pearson, the deputy director for employment, labour and social affairs at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris, said, “We are getting worse at making forecasts because the world is getting more complicated.” Way to go, Mark.</div>

We ignore every piece of proximate macroeconomic information. We do not believe these data help us assess the ultimate success or failure of a business. We have no economic advisers, we do not talk to economists at banks or brokerage houses, and we do not discuss any economic indicators in our team meetings.

The proximate causes of market movements are unknown, and in my view, unknowable. Let’s go back to July 24, 2002. The Dow soared 489 points, the second-best point gain ever and the best percentage gain since 1987.10 The reason? Even after reading many news articles, I am not sure. Anyway, according to various media sources, the rally was the result of congressional negotiators reaching some kind of an agreement on corporate fraud. Also, some executives who had been defrauding the cable company Adelphia were arrested. Whatever.

You would have thought that the so-called corruption investigations in the United States should not affect the UK markets. Well, we fund managers never cease to amaze. The FTSE 250 went up by 1.5 percent the day after the U.S. markets moved up 6 percent, and the stock prices of large companies, as shown in the first column of table 4.2, shot up by 2 to 9 percent.

The explanation that comes to mind was offered by the great John Maynard Keynes when he opined that the stock market players were playing a complex guessing game.11 He asked us to imagine a game in which competitors pick the six prettiest faces from one hundred photographs. The winner is not the one who picks the prettiest faces but whose choices match the average of all the competitors.
How would you play a game like this? My approach would be to not choose the six prettiest faces and instead spend my time guessing which six the other players will select. Before I were to start feeling smug about my second-level strategy, I would realize that a more insightful competitor would go a step further to a third level. They would try to guess what the average opinion expects the average beauty to be. And so on to even higher levels.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">7月24日美国股指大幅上涨后，为何英国基金经理们次日就大举买入英国石油、劳斯莱斯和帝亚吉欧的股票？这让人想起约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯的经典解释——他认为股市参与者在进行一场复杂的竞猜游戏。这位经济学大师曾让我们想象这样一个比赛：参赛者需从百张照片中选出六张最美面孔，获胜者并非选出真正最美面孔的人，而是其选择最接近全体参赛者平均偏好的人。

你会如何应对这类游戏？我的策略是放弃挑选真正最美的六张脸，转而推测其他参赛者的选择。但就在我为自己第二层的策略沾沾自喜时，更精明的竞争者会进入第三层思考：他们会揣测"大众认为大众的审美标准是什么"。如此类推，思维博弈还能攀升至更高层级。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">Keynes had learned from bitter experience that this market guessing game is a colossal waste of time. In the 1920s, he used a detailed economic model to predict market levels and failed to see the Great Crash of 1929. He also underperformed the market during this period. He switched to picking stocks and, like Buffett, eschewed diversification. He declared, “The right method of investment is to put fairly large sums of money into enterprises one thinks one knows something about.”</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">凯恩斯从惨痛经历中领悟到，这种市场猜谜游戏纯粹是浪费时间。20世纪20年代，他曾运用精密的经济模型预测市场走势，却未能预见1929年大崩盘。在此期间，他的投资表现也逊于大盘。后来他转向股票精选策略，和巴菲特一样拒绝分散投资。他宣称："正确的投资方法是将可观资金投入自己有所了解的行业。"</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">No wonder he turned out to be an excellent investor. Keynes managed the endowment of King’s College, Cambridge, from 1924 to 1946. During this twenty-two-year period, he compounded the college’s wealth by almost 14 percent a year. If someone had invested £100 with Keynes at the start of 1924, it would have been worth about £1,675 at the time of his death in 1946. The same money invested in the UK stock market index would have been worth only £424. Astonishingly, this period included the Great Crash of 1929, the Great Depression, and the Second World War.
Should the financial world not have absorbed Keynes’s insights? Ha!</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">难怪他后来成为了一位杰出的投资者。凯恩斯从1924年到1946年管理着剑桥大学国王学院的捐赠基金。在这22年间，他每年为学院创造的财富复合增长率接近14%。如果有人1924年初交给凯恩斯100英镑投资，到1946年他去世时，这笔钱将增值至约1675英镑。而同样的资金如果投资于英国股市指数，价值仅为424英镑。令人惊叹的是，这段时期包含了1929年大崩盘、经济大萧条和第二次世界大战。

金融界难道不该汲取凯恩斯的真知灼见吗？哈！</div>

Not once did the forecasters believe that the stock market could go down. The reality? The market fell on six occasions.

The median consensus among the forecasters was that the market would rise by 2.7 percent in 2020.12 If the forecasters had known then that a pandemic would rage across the world from March 2020 until December 2020, what do you think their forecast for 2020 would have been? We will never know, but I bet they would have predicted a huge fall in the market. In any event, the S&P 500 rose by 16.3 percentage points in 2020. But 2020’s pandemic was a once-in-a-century event, and we should not hold it against the forecasters that they were wrong by 13.6 percentage points. Fair enough.
What if we assess the forecast of an acknowledged master forecaster from early May 2020? Only eight months of the year remain, the pandemic has been raging for four months, and the dire impact on the economy seems quite evident. I would think that an “expert” could go wrong at this stage but probably not by much.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">回到2019年12月。请记住当时无人知晓新冠大流行的存在。预测者们的中位数共识是2020年市场将上涨2.7%。倘若他们当时预知一场大流行病将从2020年3月肆虐至12月，你认为这些人对2020年的预测会如何调整？我们永远无从得知，但我敢打赌他们必定会预测市场暴跌。然而事实是，2020年标普500指数实际上涨了16.3个百分点。不过这场百年一遇的疫情实属特例，我们也不该因预测者13.6个百分点的误差而苛责他们——这很公平。

那么如果我们评估2020年5月初某位公认预测大师的预言呢？此时全年仅剩八个月，疫情已肆虐四个月，其对经济的毁灭性影响已昭然若揭。按理说"专家"在这个阶段或许仍会误判，但偏差总该不会太大。</div>

Even if you take the highest number of 10 percent returns in Dent’s band, that is an error of 22 percentage points over eight months. Or an annualized error of 33 percent. Oops.
Before you blame me for choosing a forecaster who turned out to be egregiously wrong, I challenge you to find me an expert who asserted in May 2020 that the market would be up by 25 to 30 percent by the end of December. I could not find one. Trust me, I tried.</div>

At the end of annus horribilis 2020, I realized I was wrong by $6 billion.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">平心而论，我从未遇见过哪位金融从业者宣称市场走势可以预测。但为何业界人士仍耗费大量时间痴迷于预测未来市场？为何基金经理们要殚精竭虑地揣测同行的想法与行动？扭曲的激励机制、虚幻的安全感、争强好胜的心理——各种缘由不胜枚举。其实这些都不重要。

我们向来无视所有市场预测。当然，或许并非完全如此。
每当想开怀大笑时，我确实会翻看这些预测报告。

在糟糕透顶的2020年结束时，我发现自己误判了60亿美元。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">48.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">In early September 2020, Nikola was a stock market darling. The start-up had listed barely a year earlier at a valuation of $4 billion. Its value had since quintupled to almost $20 billion. Led by its charismatic founder, Trevor Milton, who was often compared to Elon Musk, Nikola was planning to develop semitrucks powered by hydrogen fuel cells and batteries. It had just announced a partnership with GM wherein the Detroit giant would get an 11 percent stake for $2 billion in return for a contract to engineer and build Nikola’s semitrucks.
On September 10, 2020, a reputed investment fund and short seller called Hindenburg Research published a scathing report titled Nikola: How to Parlay an Ocean of Lies Into a Partnership with the Largest Auto OEM in America. The first line of the report states that Nikola was “an intricate fraud built on dozens of lies over the course of its founder and executive chairman Trevor Milton’s career.”14</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">2020年9月初，尼古拉公司还是股市宠儿。这家初创企业上市仅一年，估值已达40亿美元，随后更飙升至近200亿美元。在常被与埃隆·马斯克相提并论的魅力型创始人特雷弗·米尔顿带领下，该公司计划研发氢燃料电池与蓄电池驱动的半挂卡车，并刚宣布与通用汽车达成合作——这家底特律巨头将斥资20亿美元获得11%股份，换取尼古拉半挂卡车的工程设计及制造合同。

2020年9月10日，知名投资基金及做空机构兴登堡研究发布题为《尼古拉：如何用漫天谎言缔造美国最大汽车制造商合作》的尖锐报告。报告开篇直指尼古拉是"创始人兼执行董事长特雷弗·米尔顿职业生涯中构筑的精密骗局，建立在数十个谎言之上"。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">49.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">In 2017, to prove that its technology worked, Nikola shared a video titled “Nikola One in Motion,” which showed its prototype semitruck speeding along a road. Hindenburg claimed that the company had simply towed an ordinary truck to the top of a hill in a remote area and had filmed it rolling down the hill. After the report was published, Nikola felt compelled to acknowledge this fact by stating, “Nikola never stated its truck was driving under its own propulsion in the video.” What?! What else was a speeding truck supposed to show? The road?</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">2017年，为证明其技术可行，尼古拉公司发布了一段名为"尼古拉一号行进中"的视频，画面显示其半挂卡车原型车在道路上飞驰。兴登堡研究公司指控该公司只是将一辆普通卡车拖至偏远地区的山顶，拍摄其沿坡滑行的画面。报告发布后，尼古拉公司被迫承认："视频中从未声明卡车依靠自身动力行驶"。这算什么？飞驰的卡车除了展示动力还能展示什么？路面吗？</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">50.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">The revelation of this bare-faced lie was just the start of the lengthy report. Hindenburg’s research unearthed several more problems. Nikola did not have a battery technology despite Milton’s claims to the contrary; it did not possess hydrogen fuel cell expertise; Milton had a history of taking technology from others and then claiming it as his own; Milton also had a track record of troubled partnerships that ended in failure, lawsuits, and recriminations; and Milton had claimed that Nikola’s corporate headquarters were completely off-grid and used 3.5-megawatt solar panels, though no headquarters existed. I could list many more damning assertions made by Hindenburg in its lengthy report, but suffice to say that the future seemed bleak for Nikola.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">这份赤裸裸谎言的揭露仅是长篇报告的开端。兴登堡研究公司还挖出了更多问题：尽管米尔顿曾公开宣称拥有电池技术，尼古拉公司实际并不具备；该公司也不掌握氢燃料电池核心技术；米尔顿存在剽窃他人技术并据为己有的前科；其商业合作屡屡以纠纷、诉讼和相互指责告终；米尔顿声称尼古拉总部完全脱离电网并采用3.5兆瓦太阳能板，但事实上总部根本不存在。兴登堡报告中还有更多毁灭性指控，但仅凭这些就足以表明——尼古拉公司的前景已然黯淡。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">51.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Trevor Milton resigned within a few days of the report, and GM ended its partnership discussions with the company. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice launched their own investigations. Unsurprisingly, the stock price started crashing.
Here is my question for you: What do you think Nikola’s market value was at the end of December 2020, three months after the Hindenburg exposé? Remember that the company had no battery or fuel cell technology, had no prototype, its founder had exited ignominiously, GM had terminated the partnership, and the government had begun investigating fraud. My answer would be close to zero.
Nope. It was $6 billion!</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">特雷弗·米尔顿在报告发布数日内辞职，通用汽车随即终止了与该公司的合作洽谈。美国证券交易委员会和司法部相继启动调查。不出所料，其股价开始暴跌。

现在我要问你：你认为在兴登堡做空报告发布三个月后，2020年12月底尼古拉公司的市值是多少？请记住，这家公司既没有电池技术也没有燃料电池技术，没有原型车，创始人已不光彩地退出，通用汽车终止了合作，政府也启动了欺诈调查。要我说，市值应该接近于零。

但事实是：60亿美元！</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">52.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">The Hindenburg report appeared to be fact based: They backed up almost all their assertions with documents, photographs, text messages, videos, and interviews. I am in no position to double-check their research. However, the facts that Milton resigned and GM terminated the partnership seem to indicate that a reasonable portion—if not all—of the report was credible. If so, how does one explain a $6 billion valuation for a company like Nikola? That’s an unfair question because I doubt anyone fully understands how companies are valued. But in this case, I want to offer a two-word answer.
Thematic investing.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">这份兴登堡报告似乎基于事实：他们几乎所有的论断都有文件、照片、短信、视频和访谈作为支撑。我无法核实他们的调查。然而，米尔顿的辞职和通用汽车终止合作的事实似乎表明，该报告有相当一部分——即便不是全部——是可信的。既然如此，像尼古拉这样的公司为何能获得60亿美元的估值？这个问题并不公平，因为我怀疑没人能完全理解企业估值逻辑。但针对这个案例，我想用两个词来回答：  
主题投资。</div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">53.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">The theme being “new-age automotive companies will rule the world.” Automotive tech start-ups have been a rage since 2020.15 According to an article in the Financial Times in January 2021, these companies had amassed a market value of $60 billion, but most had not generated a single dollar of revenue. And why didn’t they have any revenue? Because, like Nikola, they didn’t even have a product! The popular saying “fact is stranger than fiction” is tailor made for the valuation of new-age automotive start-ups.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">主题是"新时代汽车公司将统治世界"。自2020年起，汽车科技初创企业便掀起狂热浪潮。据《金融时报》2021年1月报道，这些公司已积累600亿美元市值，但多数企业尚未创造一分钱营收。为何它们毫无收入？因为正如尼古拉汽车一样——这些公司连产品都尚未问世！"现实比小说更离奇"这句俗语，恰如其分地诠释了新时代汽车初创企业的估值现象。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">54.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">The FT article names nine listed start-ups, the largest of which was QuantumScape, valued at $19 billion. This company projects its first revenue of $14 million in 2024. In 2028, just four years after generating its first revenue, the company expects to touch $10 billion revenue! As a matter of comparison, after recording its first revenue in 2008, Tesla took nine years to cross $10 billion. And remember that Tesla had the lion’s share of the market in those years. The QuantumScape website proclaims that the company’s mission is “to revolutionize energy storage to enable a sustainable future.” Its investors range from blue-blooded venture capital firms like Kleiner Perkins and Lightspeed to car companies like Volkswagen and SAIC.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">英国《金融时报》的文章列举了九家上市初创企业，其中规模最大的是估值190亿美元的QuantumScape。该公司预计2024年将实现首笔1400万美元收入，而到2028年——即产生收入仅四年后——其营收有望突破100亿美元！作为对比，特斯拉在2008年实现首笔收入后，历时九年才突破百亿美元大关。要知道，当时特斯拉已占据市场主导地位。QuantumScape官网宣称其使命是"通过革新储能技术推动可持续未来"，投资者阵容涵盖Kleiner Perkins、Lightspeed等顶级风投机构，以及大众、上汽等汽车制造商。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">And there were many others. Hyliion’s market value was $2.6 billion, and it was planning to manufacture hybrid trucks; Velodyne Lidar, $3.9 billion, sensing solutions for autonomous vehicles; Fisker, $4.1 billion, electric cars; Luminar Technologies, $10.1 billion, object detection technology; Canoo, $4 billion, electric vehicles. You get the picture.
A foolproof method of checking the interest level in a concept or theme is to analyze Google searches using Google Trends. If you do so for the term “electric vehicles” between January 2014 and January 2019 in the United States, you will see a relatively flat trend. However, between January 2019 and February 2021, interest in electric vehicles quadrupled. Now, check out the dates the companies just mentioned went public:
NikolaJune 2020
Velodyne LidarSeptember 2020
FiskerOctober 2020
HyliionOctober 2020
QuantumScapeNovember 2020
CanooDecember 2020
LuminarDecember 2020</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">类似的例子不胜枚举。Hyliion市值26亿美元，主营混合动力卡车制造；Velodyne Lidar市值39亿美元，专注自动驾驶传感解决方案；Fisker市值41亿美元，研发电动汽车；Luminar Technologies市值101亿美元，主攻物体识别技术；Canoo市值40亿美元，同样深耕电动车领域——这些数字足以说明问题。

验证某个概念或主题的热度，最可靠的方法是利用谷歌趋势分析搜索数据。若查看2014年1月至2019年1月期间美国地区"电动汽车"的搜索趋势，可见曲线基本平稳。但2019年1月至2021年2月期间，该词搜索量激增四倍。再看前文提及企业的上市时间表：
Nikola2020年6月  
Velodyne Lidar2020年9月  
Fisker2020年10月  
Hyliion2020年10月

            <span class="paragraph-number">56.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">I don’t know if the IPOs of these companies increased the interest level in the search term or whether the increased searches of “electric vehicles” were a leading indicator of public listings. Maybe they just fed each other in a positive feedback loop. Whatever the case may be, as you can see, there is a strong correlation between the theme of electric vehicles and the IPOs of these businesses—a classic example of a strong proximate mechanism at work.
In addition, in January 2021, there were at least eight to ten more private start-ups ready to go public, all with obvious-sounding names like ChargePoint, EVgo, Lightning eMotors, Lion Electric, and Motiv Power Systems. If the market value of the listed companies holds, I bet that in the next few years, there will be dozens more listed companies with this theme.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">我不确定是这些公司的IPO推高了搜索热度，还是"电动汽车"搜索量的增长成为它们上市的先行指标。或许二者在正向循环中相互促进。无论如何，正如所见，电动汽车主题与这些企业的公开募股存在显著关联——这正是强效邻近机制的典型范例。

此外，2021年1月时，还有至少8到10家私营初创企业蓄势待发准备上市，它们的名称都直白醒目：ChargePoint、EVgo、Lightning eMotors、Lion Electric以及Motiv Power Systems等。若已上市公司市值保持稳定，我敢断言未来几年内，这一主题的上市公司数量将激增数十家。</div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">57.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">These companies, valued at billions, with not even millions in revenue, epitomize investment strategies based on proximate themes. Like almost every proximate theme before and since, the automotive tech theme has three properties. It hypes up total addressable market (TAM), is simple to understand, and is actionable.
First, TAM. Every theme I have encountered since the start of my investing career in 1998 plays on the enormous size of the addressable market. And the size is usually so large that it dwarfs the businesses currently operating in that industry or theme. No wonder it is usually the most salient proximate cause of a theme gone wild.
In March 2021, a UBS report touted the zero-emission trucking market as potentially $1.5 trillion in size, and current manufacturers and start-ups raced to grab dominance. Tesla, which did not manufacture trucks in March 2021, had revenue of “only” $32 billion in 2020.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">这些估值数十亿却营收不足百万的公司，是围绕热点主题进行投资的典型代表。与过去及现在的几乎所有热点主题一样，汽车科技主题具备三大特征：夸大总潜在市场规模（TAM）、概念通俗易懂、具有可操作性。

首要特征是总潜在市场规模。自1998年开启投资生涯以来，我接触的每个主题都在渲染目标市场的庞大规模。这个数字往往大到令该行业现有企业的体量相形见绌，难怪它总能成为主题炒作最显著的直接诱因。

2021年3月，瑞银报告鼓吹零排放卡车市场规模可能达到1.5万亿美元，现有制造商与初创企业竞相争夺主导权。而当时尚未生产卡车的特斯拉，2020年营收"仅"为320亿美元。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">58.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">In my experience, there is only one problem with chasing a proximate theme based on TAM. It’s useless. It makes astrology-based forecasts look respectable. TAM is pointless because it does not tell us whether any profits will be made, and even if a business can be profitable, TAM is silent on who will make that moolah.
One of the largest TAMs is that of apparel and footwear.16 The U.S. market for apparel and footwear is about $370 billion. It is also one of the hardest places to make money. The lack of robustness of this industry was also evident during the pandemic when scores of apparel and footwear companies declared bankruptcies: Brooks Brothers, Centric Brands, Century 21, G-Star, JCPenney, J. Crew, John Varvatos, Neiman Marcus, Tailored Brands, and many more. Someone forgot to tell these companies that their TAM would save them.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">根据我的经验，围绕总体有效市场（TAM）追逐短期主题只有一个问题——毫无意义。这种预测方式甚至让占星术都显得可信。TAM的核心缺陷在于它既无法预示盈利可能性，也无法指明最终获利者，即便某个行业确实存在利润空间。

服装鞋履行业拥有最庞大的TAM规模之一，美国市场年产值约3700亿美元。但这恰恰是最难盈利的领域之一。疫情期间该行业的脆弱性暴露无遗：Brooks Brothers、Centric Brands、Century 21、G-Star、JCPenney、J.Crew、John Varvatos、Neiman Marcus、Tailored Brands等数十家企业相继破产。显然，没人提醒过这些企业：TAM数据根本救不了它们。</div>

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">59.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Even prepandemic, most apparel brands struggled to grow and make a decent income. Take the example of a well-known brand like Gap. It hasn’t grown in the United States since 2007, with sales almost flat at $15 to $16 billion, and it achieved its peak net income of $1.3 billion back in 2014. Guess’s revenue fluctuated between $2 billion to $2.6 billion between 2009 and 2020, and its ROCE hasn’t crossed 10 percent since 2016. Abercrombie & Fitch’s revenue in 2006 was $3.3 billion, and it grew to only $3.6 billion by 2019. It, too, has not earned more than 10 percent ROCE since 2014.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">即便在疫情前，多数服装品牌也难以实现增长和可观盈利。以盖普（Gap）这类知名品牌为例：该品牌自2007年起在美国市场增长停滞，销售额长期徘徊在150亿至160亿美元之间，其13亿美元的净利润峰值还要追溯至2014年。盖尔斯（Guess）在2009至2020年间营收波动于20亿至26亿美元区间，自2016年起资本回报率（ROCE）始终未突破10%。Abercrombie & Fitch 2006年营收为33亿美元，到2019年仅微增至36亿美元，且自2014年以来资本回报率同样未超过10%。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">60.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">The global market for apparel and footwear is about $1.9 trillion, a colossal TAM. But the only apparel companies that seem to consistently grow their sales and churn profits are H&M, Uniqlo, and Zara. Other industries like airlines, restaurants, infrastructure, banking, and retailing are the same. Their TAMs are quite high, but most industry players don’t make any money. So what use is TAM to a long-term investor?</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">全球服装和鞋类市场规模约为1.9万亿美元，是个巨大的总可用市场。但似乎只有H&M、优衣库和Zara这几家服装公司能持续实现销售增长并稳定盈利。航空、餐饮、基建、银行和零售等其他行业也是如此——这些行业的总可用市场虽大，多数从业者却无利可图。那么对长期投资者而言，总可用市场究竟有何意义？</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">61.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">The second reason for the seductiveness of a proximate theme is its simplicity. Even a casual reader of business news will be aware of themes like e-commerce, renewable energy, electric vehicles, fintech, food delivery, artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, infrastructure, and biotech. Unlike economic forecasting, which is full of jargon like “GDP” and “monetary supply,” a layperson can relate to themes. Anyone can understand what renewable energy is and that the country needs a lot more infrastructure investment. For the automotive tech start-ups, the simple argument goes as follows. Electric and autonomous vehicles will conquer the world, and since Tesla’s market value is $700 billion, shouldn’t this theme capture trillions of dollars of value in the near future? And if so, why shouldn’t a start-up be valued at billions of dollars? The premise is seductive because it is straightforward.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">邻近主题具有吸引力的第二个原因在于其简洁性。即便是商业新闻的随意浏览者，也会熟悉电子商务、可再生能源、电动汽车、金融科技、外卖配送、人工智能、自动驾驶汽车、基础设施和生物科技等主题。与经济预测充斥着"GDP""货币供应量"等专业术语不同，普通人也能理解这些主题。任何人都明白什么是可再生能源，也知道国家需要加大基础设施投资。对于汽车科技初创企业而言，其逻辑简单直白：电动和自动驾驶汽车将席卷全球，既然特斯拉市值已达7000亿美元，这个主题难道不该在不久的将来创造数万亿美元价值吗？若果真如此，一家初创公司为何不能拥有数十亿美元的估值？这种前提假设之所以诱人，正因其简单明了。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">62.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Third, it is actionable. If you believe in the theme that consumers will order more food sitting at home because it is cheaper and easier than dining out, you can invest in DoorDash or Deliveroo. Are you interested in an electric vehicle company with actual revenues? Hail Tesla. Do you believe in the providers of technology rather than the car? Velodyne Lidar beckons. Do you think trucks are a bigger opportunity? Nikola is pining for you. Why does it matter that its founder was probably a charlatan?
I don’t know where the theme of automotive start-ups will end up in 2025 or 2030. What I do know, based on the history of capital markets and new-age technologies like railways and the internet, is that this theme will face its comeuppance someday.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">第三，它具有可操作性。如果你认同"消费者将因居家点餐比外出就餐更便宜便捷而增加订餐量"这一主题，就可以投资DoorDash或Deliveroo。你对已有实际营收的电动车企业感兴趣？特斯拉在向你招手。你更看好技术供应商而非整车厂商？Velodyne激光雷达正等待你的青睐。你认为卡车领域机遇更大？尼古拉汽车对你翘首以盼——即便其创始人可能是个江湖骗子，这又有什么关系？

我无法预知汽车初创企业的主题故事在2025或2030年会如何收场。但根据资本市场以及铁路、互联网等新兴技术的历史经验，我确信这个主题终将迎来清算之日。</div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">63.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Many readers will (not fondly) remember the theme ascendant in the early 2000s that home prices will rise forever. Any bank or financial company riding this theme was rewarded with increasing stock prices. Now we know that home prices don’t keep rising, and pricier homes bought with heavy borrowing need to fall in price only slightly for panic to set in. No one investing in the theme “homes are an unbeatable investment” could have imagined that the following marquee names would go bankrupt or need a huge bailout: Lehman (assets of $691 billion), Washington Mutual ($328 billion), CIT Group ($80 billion), Thornburg Mortgage ($39 billion), General Growth Properties ($30 billion), and several more.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">许多读者会（并不愉快地）记得21世纪初盛行的一个观点——房价将永远上涨。任何顺应这一趋势的银行或金融公司都获得了股价攀升的回报。如今我们已然明白房价不会持续上涨，而那些通过高额贷款购买的昂贵住宅只需价格轻微下跌就会引发恐慌。那些信奉"房产是稳赚不赔的投资"的人，恐怕从未想象过以下这些巨头会破产或需要巨额救助：雷曼兄弟（资产6910亿美元）、华盛顿互惠银行（3280亿美元）、CIT集团（800亿美元）、桑伯格抵押贷款公司（390亿美元）、通用成长物业公司（300亿美元），以及更多企业。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">The Indian market is no different. At various times since the start of my investing career in 1998, I have witnessed the following themes create and then destroy billions of dollars of value in the capital markets: real estate, infrastructure, education, microfinance, consumer lending, and technology services. In addition, until early 2022, on paper, the following themes have created (but not yet destroyed) a lot of value in Indian private markets: edtech, fintech, e-commerce, software-as-a-service (SaaS), logistics, and social media. Based on history, many of these concepts will crater; I just don’t know which ones or when.
How should we separate the proximate causes from the ultimate ones when there is euphoria or bearishness in a theme? Unfortunately, I am not aware of a foolproof method for doing so. But here is what we do.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">印度市场也不例外。自1998年我的投资生涯开启以来，我曾多次目睹以下主题在资本市场中创造继而摧毁数十亿美元价值：房地产、基础设施、教育、小额信贷、消费贷款和技术服务。此外，截至2022年初，从账面来看，以下主题已在印度私募市场创造（但尚未摧毁）大量价值：教育科技、金融科技、电子商务、软件即服务（SaaS）、物流和社交媒体。历史经验表明，其中许多概念终将崩塌；只是我无法预知具体哪些领域或何时会发生。

当某个主题出现狂热或悲观情绪时，我们该如何区分直接诱因与根本原因？遗憾的是，我并不知晓万全之策。但以下是我们采取的做法。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">65.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">We define our unit of analysis clearly as the company. Not the economy, not the market, not a theme. We care about the fundamentals of the company—nothing else. We have never invested in a theme and never will.
Again, just to be clear, I am not implying that thematic investing is flawed. Maybe some fund managers can do it successfully.
We would if we could, but we can’t, so we won’t.
Proximate Company-Specific Causes
In December 2016, after almost three years of Vaibhav Global’s continuous underperformance, for the first time we actively debated whether we should exit entirely. Were we confusing an ultimate cause for a proximate one?</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">我们明确将分析单位界定为公司本身——而非经济大势、市场行情或热门主题。我们只关注企业的基本面，仅此而已。我们从未也永远不会追逐主题投资。
需要再次澄清的是，我并非暗示主题投资存在缺陷。或许某些基金经理能以此制胜。
若能力所及，我们自当效仿；但力有不逮，故不为也。

近因分析：企业特质
2016年12月，在Vaibhav Global股价持续三年低迷后，我们首次认真讨论是否该全面撤资。我们是否将根本原因与近因混为一谈了？</div>

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">66.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Vaibhav is a retailer of low-priced jewelry and other accessories in the United States and the United Kingdom that sells through TV and the internet. One can shop at https://www.shoplc.com in the United States or https://www.tjc.co.uk in the United Kingdom. Please do—you will find its deals unbeatable. Vaibhav competes primarily with home shopping giants like QVC and HSN, as well as hundreds of other online and offline retailers.
We invested in Vaibhav in late 2007. After underwhelming performance for a few years, the company grew its revenue and operating profit at an annualized rate of about 30 percent from the year ended March 2011 to 2014. In July 2014, the stock price hit an all-time high of INR 174; our buy price was INR 48. Sunil Agarwal, the founder and CEO, had done a stellar job in recent years.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">Vaibhav是一家在美国和英国经营低价珠宝及配饰的零售商，通过电视和网络渠道销售商品。顾客可通过美国官网https://www.shoplc.com或英国官网https://www.tjc.co.uk选购——您将发现其价格优势无可匹敌。该企业主要与QVC、HSN等家庭购物巨头以及数百家线上线下零售商展开竞争。

我们于2007年末投资Vaibhav。在经历数年平淡表现后，该公司从2011年3月至2014财年期间实现了约30%的年均营收及营业利润增长率。2014年7月，其股价创下174印度卢比的历史新高（我们的买入价为48卢比）。创始人兼首席执行官苏尼尔·阿加瓦尔近年来表现出色。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">67.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">However, from April 2014, the company’s sales and profits started falling primarily owing to three self-inflicted missteps. First, Vaibhav did not respond to a significant strategic move by competition in the United States. Every major competitor of Vaibhav had started offering customers an option to pay in installments. However, Vaibhav refused to follow in their footsteps. Sunil did not want to take an unnecessary financial risk. Also, Vaibhav’s average sale price is only about $20 to $25 per piece compared to $50 to $100 for competition. Sunil thought that customers would not care about installments if they got a quality product at a low enough price. It turns out that they did.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">然而自2014年4月起，该公司的销售额与利润开始下滑，主要归咎于三个战略性失误。首先，Vaibhav未能应对美国市场竞争对手的重大策略调整——当时所有主要竞品都开始向消费者提供分期付款服务，但Vaibhav拒绝效仿。创始人苏尼尔不愿承担额外的财务风险，且Vaibhav产品均价仅为20-25美元/件，远低于竞品50-100美元的定价区间。苏尼尔原以为只要以足够低廉的价格提供优质产品，消费者便不会在意分期服务，但事实证明他判断失误。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">68.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Second, the company faltered in designing and implementing a robust technology platform. The company lagged behind all its peers on the quality of its customer-facing websites and apps. Even some of its back-end technology platforms (e.g., which helped decide which products to merchandise when) were outdated and inflexible. Vaibhav’s internet sales accounted for 16 percent of company revenue, whereas this number was 51 percent for QVC. The company fired its head of technology, but the new leader was taking time to fix the problems.
Last, Vaibhav lost a few key senior managers. Sunil had fired some of them, but some had left for greener pastures. He was also finding it hard to attract quality talent to fill the vacancies.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">其次，该公司在设计和构建稳健的技术平台方面进展迟缓。其面向客户的网站和应用程序质量落后于所有同行，甚至部分后端技术平台（例如商品选品决策系统）也已过时且缺乏灵活性。Vaibhav的线上销售额仅占公司总收入的16%，而行业龙头QVC的这一数字高达51%。公司解雇了原技术主管，但继任者仍需时间解决遗留问题。

最后，Vaibhav流失了数名核心高管。其中部分人员由苏尼尔解聘，另一些则主动跳槽谋求更好发展。与此同时，公司也难以为空缺岗位招募到优质人才。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">69.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">From the year ended March 2014 to March 2016, sales fell by 2 percent, but profits declined by almost 70 percent. ROCE collapsed from 55 percent in 2014 to 13 percent in 2016. The stock market had reacted appropriately: Vaibhav’s stock price was INR 54 in December 2016, a fall of almost 70 percent from its previous peak in July 2014.
We were now in a dilemma. Were these problems—a delay in responding to competition, the lack of a robust technology platform, a paucity of senior leaders—proximate causes of stock price decline? Or did these headaches reflect a more fundamental and long-term issue with the company? Were these issues “fixable,” or should we abandon any hope of revival? We are permanent owners in businesses and do not sell unless there is irreparable damage to a business. Were these lapses temporary, or would the company be able to overcome this adversity?</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">截至2014年3月的财年至2016年3月期间，销售额下降2%，但利润暴跌近70%。资本运用回报率从2014年的55%骤降至2016年的13%。股市反应如实：Vaibhav股价在2016年12月跌至54印度卢比，较2014年7月峰值重挫近70%。

我们陷入了两难。这些困境——应对竞争迟缓、技术平台薄弱、高层人才匮乏——究竟是股价下跌的直接诱因？还是暴露了公司更深层的长期顽疾？这些问题能否"修复"？我们是否该放弃复苏希望？作为企业的永久所有者，我们除非遭遇不可逆的损害否则绝不抛售。这些失误是暂时的阵痛，还是公司无力跨越的深渊？</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">70.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">As I have discussed in this chapter, we ignore proximate problems related to the economy, the market, and even the industry. But the dilemma is much trickier to address when the proximate cause of problems relates to the company itself. Suppose the sales growth and profitability of the company has declined in the past few quarters, whereas its main competitors showed no such struggle. How would you decide if the performance issues are related to proximate (and hence temporary) causes or ultimate (and hence more permanent) causes? In my experience, developing a method and an instinct to separate proximate and ultimate causes of failure or success when they relate to a company event is invaluable for a long-term investor.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">正如本章所述，我们往往忽视与经济、市场乃至行业相关的近因问题。但当问题根源直指企业自身时，这种困境就变得尤为棘手。假设某公司过去几个季度销售增长与盈利能力持续下滑，而其主要竞争对手却未现颓势。此时你该如何判断：这些业绩问题究竟是源于暂时性的近因，还是更为根本性的终极原因？根据我的经验，当企业出现经营波动时，建立区分成败近因与终极原因的方法论与直觉判断力，对长期投资者而言具有不可估量的价值。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">71.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">I have been an investor for more than two decades, and this is where I stumble most often. As usual, at the extremes, the decision is straightforward. If the share price declines owing to a downturn in one or two quarters, we ignore the decline, considering it a proximate event. But if the decline results from a loss of market share for three years in a row, we ask if there is something fundamentally wrong with the business. It is the gray area in between these extremes that creates the worst headaches for us. I do not know of any foolproof method of cracking the conundrum; the answer is almost always very company specific.
Vaibhav was in this gray zone. Maybe the proximate issues indicated ultimate problems, but maybe they didn’t.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">我从事投资已有二十余载，最常在此处栽跟头。通常来说，极端情况下的决策反而简单明了。若股价因一两个季度的业绩波动下跌，我们会将其视为短期波动而忽略；但若下跌源于连续三年市场份额流失，我们就会质疑企业是否出了根本性问题。真正令人头疼的正是介于两者之间的灰色地带。我至今没找到破解这个难题的万全之策，答案往往因公司而异。

维布当时就身处这种灰色地带。那些短期问题或许暗示着深层危机，但也可能只是虚惊一场。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">72.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">We decided to stay with the business. Under Sunil’s leadership, the company had performed exceedingly well until only three years earlier, and nothing had changed in the market since then. There were no new entrants, and customer behavior remained the same. More importantly, Vaibhav’s competitive position of selling jewelry and accessories in the range of $20 to $25 remained intact even during the difficult years. None of its competitors was able or willing to match Vaibhav’s value proposition. Also, as time passed, we saw Sunil taking timely steps to address the issues. Late in 2014, he started offering installment plans, which put a stop to customer attrition. Despite declining profits, he invested aggressively in building the technology team and infrastructure. Finally, as he promoted some internal staff to leadership positions instead of hiring from outside, we could discern some early signs of progress.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">我们决定继续经营这家企业。在苏尼尔的领导下，该公司直到三年前还表现极佳，而此后市场环境并未发生变化。没有新进入者，客户行为也保持稳定。更重要的是，即使在困难时期，维布夫在20至25美元价位段的珠宝首饰销售竞争地位依然稳固，没有竞争对手能够或愿意匹配其价值主张。此外，随着时间的推移，我们看到苏尼尔正在及时采取措施解决问题。2014年底，他开始推出分期付款计划，有效遏制了客户流失。尽管利润下滑，他仍大力投资技术团队和基础设施的建设。最后，当他提拔内部员工而非外聘人员担任领导职位时，我们已能察觉到初步的改善迹象。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">73.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Luckily for us, Sunil and his team did turn the business around. Sales grew by 11 percent annually from the year ended March 2016 to 2020, but, more impressively, operating profits grew almost five-fold. ROCE jumped from 13 percent to 45 percent during this period, and the annual free cash flow almost quadrupled. The stock price jumped six-and-a-half-fold from INR 54 in December 2016 to INR 352 in September 2022.
Vaibhav may have turned out well for us (for now). But this was a touch-and-go decision. It could have gone either way. Our instinct to stay in business as permanent owners helped us stay the course. Most importantly, we got very lucky.
The Pain and the Gain of Headline Harassment
Let’s go back to the question I raised at the beginning of the chapter. You have sunk $70,000 in a fund that is now worth $36,000. Everything the fund manager touches seems to be heading down. Apart from continuing to tear your hair out, what should you do?
Nothing.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">所幸，苏尼尔和他的团队确实让公司起死回生。从截至2016年3月的财年到2020年，销售额年均增长11%，但更令人惊叹的是营业利润增长了近五倍。同期资本运用回报率从13%跃升至45%，年自由现金流几乎翻了两番。股价从2016年12月的54卢比飙升至2022年9月的352卢比，涨幅达六倍半。

维巴夫的投资（截至目前）或许为我们带来了不错的结果。但这曾是个千钧一发的决定，成败就在一念之间。我们坚持长期持有企业股权的本能，让我们守住了方向。最重要的是——我们非常幸运。

头条新闻骚扰之痛与得
让我们回到本章开头提出的问题：你投入7万美元的基金如今只剩3.6万美元，基金经理的每项操作似乎都在亏损。除了继续抓狂，你该怎么办？

什么也不做。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">74.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">At the end of the anecdote, the time was March 2009. If you had done nothing and continued to hold the fund, your $36,000 would be worth a little more than $770,000 at the end of September 2022. Which is a multiple of 21.4 times over 13.5 years. In comparison, the main stock index grew six-fold during these years.
As you may have guessed, this was not a hypothetical situation. I have described what transpired at Nalanda. What you see in the numbers I’ve given is the result of our aggressive buying during the global financial crisis of 2008 and its dramatic longer-term impact on the fund’s performance. The only change you would need to make is to switch dollars to rupees.17 Your patience would have paid. A lot.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">这则轶事的结尾时间是2009年3月。如果你当时选择按兵不动，继续持有这只基金，到2022年9月底，你的3.6万美元将增值至77万美元以上——相当于13.5年间实现了21.4倍的收益。相比之下，同期主要股票指数仅增长六倍。

你或许已猜到，这并非假设情景。我所描述的正是那澜陀基金的真实经历。上述数字展现的，正是我们在2008年全球金融危机期间大举买入的决策，以及这一决策对基金长期表现的惊人影响。唯一需要调整的只是将美元单位换算为卢比。你的耐心终将获得超乎想象的回报。</div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">75.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">As the Indian market started falling from March 2008, we started buying high-quality businesses, and we did not stop until early 2009. The further the market fell, the greater our buying frenzy was. In December 2008, the fund had delivered an annualized return (called the internal rate of return, or IRR, in investing parlance) of −55 percent (!), and we continued to invest as much as we could. The fund’s annualized rupee return as of September 2022 was 20.3 percent (after payment of all fees and expenses).
What allowed us to invest when the world seemed to be coming to an end? We ignored all proximate causes of stock price decline and focused exclusively on the ultimate sources of success of a business. Let’s walk through an example.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">2008年3月印度市场开始下跌时，我们便开始买入优质企业，这一行动一直持续到2009年初。市场跌得越深，我们的买入热情就越高涨。截至2008年12月，该基金年化回报率（投资术语称为内部收益率，即IRR）已跌至-55%（！），但我们仍竭尽所能持续投资。截至2022年9月，该基金以卢比计算的年化回报率（扣除所有费用后）达到20.3%。

在全球似乎濒临崩溃之际，是什么支撑着我们持续投资？我们无视所有导致股价下跌的直接因素，只专注于企业成功的根本源泉。让我们通过一个实例来说明。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">76.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Our most successful investment to date is Page Industries. In October 2008, the company had a stellar track record of performance over more than a decade and was the number-one innerwear brand in the country. It had overtaken competitors that had started many decades before it entered India in 1995. Over the previous five years, the company had grown revenue at 32 percent per year and had earned 57 percent ROCE.
On October 7, 2008, three weeks after Lehman’s collapse, we bought 8 percent of the company for INR 455 per share. This was a 23 percent premium to the prevailing stock price of INR 370 per share. We took a notional loss the very next day after our purchase. In fact, the stock price did not cross our buy price for six months, until April 2009. At the end of July 2022, Page was at INR 48,873, a multiple of 107 times our buy price. During this period, the Sensex went up 5.5 times.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">我们迄今为止最成功的投资是佩奇工业公司。2008年10月时，该公司已拥有十余年的辉煌业绩记录，稳居国内内衣品牌榜首。自1995年进入印度市场以来，它已超越那些早它数十年起步的竞争对手。此前五年间，公司年营收增长率达32%，资本回报率高达57%。

2008年10月7日，雷曼兄弟破产三周后，我们以每股455卢比的价格收购了该公司8%的股份，较当时每股370卢比的市价溢价23%。就在买入次日，我们便遭遇账面亏损。事实上，股价直到2009年4月——即六个月后——才突破我们的买入价。截至2022年7月底，佩奇股价已达48,873卢比，是我们买入价的107倍。同期印度敏感指数仅上涨5.5倍。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">77.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Our view on Page and seven other businesses we bought during the financial crisis was that global events may affect the stock prices of high-quality companies but not their business strength; the fact that investors were dumping stocks was not a problem but an opportunity; businesses’ market valuations may take a hit but not their intrinsic value; the opportunity cost of not investing in troubled times far exceeds any near-term pain owing to notional losses. Our success with Page is only partly the result of our aggression at a time of market panic; it is largely the result of our unwillingness to sell a great business at any price. But more on that later.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">我们对佩吉公司以及金融危机期间收购的另外七家企业的看法是：全球性事件可能影响优质企业的股价，但不会削弱其业务实力；投资者抛售股票不是问题而是机遇；企业的市值可能受挫，但内在价值不会；若在动荡时期选择观望，其机会成本将远超账面浮亏带来的短期痛苦。佩吉的成功案例中，我们在市场恐慌时的果断出手仅占部分因素，更关键的是我们拒绝以任何价格抛售优质企业的坚持。关于这一点，后文将详述。</div>

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">78.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">The title of section II of this book is “Buy High Quality at a Fair Price.” This is a nice-sounding strategy but far from easy to implement in practice. The problem is that high-quality businesses are seldom available at a fair price. Markets are very efficient most of the time. However, when proximate causes get divorced from ultimate ones, markets can offer even great businesses at a fair price. We took full advantage of this temporary insanity to wade in all guns blazing. Our trailing twelve-month (TTM) PE multiple for buying Page? 18 times. Can you believe it?
This undeserved luck was the direct result of what I call “headline harassment.” While we were busy buying stellar businesses in 2008 and early 2009, the following headlines (and others like them) appeared in the most widely read Indian business daily, the Economic Times18:
“Mark-to-Market Losses Worry India Inc.” (July 18, 2008)
“Economic Activity Is Slowing Down Fast” (August 25, 2008)</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">本书第二章节的标题是"以合理价格买入优质资产"。这策略听起来美妙，实践起来却绝非易事。问题在于优质企业很少以合理价格出售——市场在多数时候都极为高效。但当表层诱因与深层根源脱节时，市场也可能将优秀企业平价抛售。我们充分利用了这种暂时性的非理性状态全力出击。当时为收购Page集团支付的过去十二个月市盈率？仅18倍。难以置信吧？

这份意外之财正是我称之为"头条新闻骚扰"现象的直接产物。在2008年至2009年初我们大举收购优质企业期间，印度发行量最大的《经济时报》接连出现如下标题：
"市值缩水困扰印度企业界"（2008年7月18日）
"经济活动正在急剧放缓"（2008年8月25日）</div>

It is common knowledge that lousy news attracts way more eyeballs than good news.19 We may blame the media for this bias, but psychologists have shown that people prefer reading bad news and remember it better. The media simply exploit an existing prejudice. In an article titled “On Wildebeests and Humans: The Preferential Detection of Negative Stimuli” in the journal Psychological Science, researchers showed that subjects remembered negative words faster and more often than positive ones.20</div>

众所周知，负面新闻总能比好消息吸引更多关注。我们或许会指责媒体的这种倾向，但心理学家已证实人们更偏爱阅读并牢记坏消息。媒体不过是在利用既有的偏见。心理学期刊《心理科学》一篇题为《角马与人类：负面刺激的优先感知》的论文指出，受试者对负面词汇的记忆速度与频次均显著高于积极词汇。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">In times of crisis, this predisposition gets a steroid boost. Imagine reading the newspapers and watching TV in the weeks and months surrounding the Lehman collapse—headline harassment would have taken its toll across the globe. No wonder wonderful businesses were finally available at a price we could not refuse.
In sharp contrast, there was no celebration of business as usual at the high-quality companies that were becoming part of our portfolio during this period. No headlines screamed, “WNS Processes Another Mortgage Application,” “Triveni’s Factory Manufactures Turbine Number 39 for the Year,” “Page Industries Adds Two More Retailers Today in the City of Aurangabad,” or “Carborundum Factory in Chennai Finishes Another Shift.”
Earlier I wrote, “Ultimate causes, thankfully, are way too dull for media coverage.” Now you know why.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">危机时期，这种倾向会像打了激素般加速膨胀。试想雷曼兄弟倒闭前后数月间，人们阅读报纸和电视新闻时的情景——铺天盖地的头条轰炸在全球范围内造成了心理创伤。难怪那些优质企业最终会以令人无法拒绝的价格出现在我们面前。

与此形成鲜明对比的是，那些在此期间被我们纳入投资组合的优质企业，依然保持着波澜不惊的日常运营。媒体不会为它们刊登这样的头条："WNS公司又处理了一份抵押贷款申请"、"特里文尼工厂今年生产了第39台涡轮机"、"佩奇工业今日在奥兰加巴德市新增两家零售商"、或是"金奈碳化硅工厂又完成了一个轮班生产"。

正如我此前所言："值得庆幸的是，根本性原因往往平淡得引不起媒体兴趣。"现在你明白其中缘由了。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">There is one more important reason we could embrace a diametrically opposite attitude to that of many of our peers in 2008. We are fortunate to have long-term investors—primarily U.S. university endowments and U.S. and European family offices—who have supported our aggression when the world seemed to be coming to an end. Not even one investor defaulted on their commitment. No one (I hope) tore at their hair! I know that many private equity and hedge funds could not persuade their investors to commit more capital in 2008.
We were very fortunate.
✳✳✳
I don’t make predictions, but after the global financial crisis of 2008, I told myself that I was unlikely to witness the same degree of stock market panic for decades. I couldn’t have been more wrong.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">我们之所以能在2008年采取与多数同行截然相反的态度，还有另一个重要原因：我们很幸运拥有长期投资者——主要是美国大学捐赠基金以及欧美家族办公室——当世界似乎濒临崩溃时，他们支持我们大胆出击。没有任何一位投资者违背出资承诺，也没有人（但愿如此）抓狂崩溃。我知道当年许多私募基金和对冲基金根本无法说服投资者追加资金。

我们实在幸运之至。

            <div class="text-block original-text">At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic dread, in March 2020, the Indian market fell 23 percent. We could not stop buying, and our investment in that single month was 12 percent more than in the previous four years combined. In sharp contrast, the foreign portfolio investors in India withdrew $8.7 billion from the Indian stock market in March 2020. We continued to be hyperactive until September 2020 and then had to stop because the prices of the businesses we were interested in had increased sharply. The total amount we invested in 2020 turned out to be more than one-third of our cumulative investments over the thirteen years from 2007 until 2019.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">2020年3月，新冠疫情引发的恐慌达到顶峰，印度股市暴跌23%。我们却无法停止买入，仅该月投资额就比前四年总和还高出12%。形成鲜明对比的是，外国证券投资者同期从印度股市撤资87亿美元。我们的投资狂热持续到2020年9月才被迫中止——只因心仪企业的股价已大幅攀升。最终我们在2020年的总投资额，竟超过了2007至2019这十三年累计投资额的三分之一。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">I don’t know if we made the right decision. However, I do know that the proximate worries of impending doom for businesses like tires, enzymes, boilers, diagnostic services, vehicle lending, and sanitaryware were divorced from their ultimate causes of success. We had been tracking many of these companies for about a decade and had great confidence that they would overcome any short-term pain over the longer run. In any event, we will know soon enough.
2030 isn’t far away.
Chapter Summary
Evolutionary theory has taught me that . . .
. . . we can reimagine investing by ignoring proximate causes of stock price movements while focusing on ultimate explanations of business success.
1. Evolutionary biology explores natural phenomena by searching for proximate and ultimate causes. Proximate mechanisms explain immediate influences on a trait. The role played by natural selection explains the ultimate cause of an organism’s success or failure in an environment.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">我不确定我们是否做出了正确的决定。但我深知，那些关于轮胎、酶制剂、锅炉、诊断服务、汽车贷款和卫浴洁具等行业即将陷入危机的表层忧虑，与其最终成功的根本原因毫无关联。我们追踪其中许多企业已近十年，深信它们终将克服短期的阵痛。无论如何，答案很快就会揭晓。  
2030年并不遥远。  

**章节概要**  
进化论教会我……  
……我们可以重构投资思维——忽略股价波动的表层诱因，聚焦企业成功的根本逻辑。  
1. 进化生物学通过探寻近因与终极因来研究自然现象。近因机制解释性状的直接影响，而自然选择的作用则揭示了生物在环境中成败的终极根源。  

（译文严格遵循原文信息密度与逻辑结构，采用"表层忧虑/根本原因"对应"proximate/ultimate"的哲学概念，保留"2030年"的悬笔效果。章节概要部分通过破折号衔接保持原文的顿悟语气，术语如"性状"符合生物学语境，未添加任何解释性内容。）</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">2. Thus, to understand the impressive size and variety of dung beetle horns, evolutionary biologists ask the proximate question (e.g., which network of genes was switched on?), as well as the ultimate question (e.g., what is the adaptive value of the horns?). Scientists understand that these are different types of questions with different types of answers and that both types must be asked.
3. The investing world, too, must differentiate between proximate and ultimate causes. Proximate causes of share price changes can result from the macroeconomy, the markets, the industry, or the company itself. Since proximate causes are highly salient (e.g., the Fed announcing an interest rate cut or a company announcing a slowing of sales growth), investors may erroneously overweight them in their decision-making process.
4. We ignore all proximate causes when analyzing businesses. We focus exclusively on the business fundamentals, or the ultimate causes of the success or failure of businesses.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">2. 因此，为理解蜣螂犄角令人惊叹的尺寸多样性，进化生物学家既探究近因问题（例如哪些基因网络被激活？），也思考终极问题（例如这些犄角的适应价值是什么？）。科学家们清楚这是两类不同性质的问题，需要不同的解答方式，且两者缺一不可。

3. 投资界同样需要区分近因与终极动因。股价波动的近因可能来自宏观经济、市场环境、行业趋势或企业自身。由于近因具有高度显著性（例如美联储宣布降息或某公司披露销售增速放缓），投资者可能在决策过程中错误地赋予其过高权重。

4. 我们在分析企业时完全忽略所有近因，只关注商业基本面——即企业成败的终极动因。</div>
