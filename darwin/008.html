            <div class="text-block original-text">Birds and Bears Bare an Aberration
It may be said that natural selection is daily and hourly scrutinising, throughout the world, every variation, even the slightest; rejecting that which is bad, preserving and adding up all that is good; silently and insensibly working, whenever and wherever opportunity offers, at the improvement of each organic being in relation to its organic and inorganic conditions of life.
Charles Darwin, On the Origin of Species, chapter 4, “Natural Selection”
Despite the difficulties we have had in reserving and the commodity economics of the industry, we expect our insurance business to both grow and make significant amounts of money—but progress will be distinctly irregular and there will be major unpleasant surprises from time to time.
Warren Buffett, annual letter to shareholders, 1986
The island looked like a war zone. And one side had lost badly. The carcasses of dead birds were strewn everywhere.</div>

可以说，自然选择每时每刻都在全球范围内审视着最细微的变异，摒弃有害的，保留并积累有益的；它无声无息地运作，抓住一切可能的时机，促使每种生物与其生存的有机和无机条件达成更完善的适应。

            <div class="text-block original-text">Peter Boag and Laurene Ratcliffe returned to the island in January 1978 and found that almost 80 percent of the birds had succumbed to the drought of 1977. Only about 290 were alive. They searched for their favorite bird—a female who had followed them around the camp in 1977—but they could not find her body. Of the two main species of birds on the island, fortis was especially hard hit. In 1977, not a single fortis laid an egg or built a nest, so no fortis babies were born. Also, every fortis born the year before the drought—in 1976—had perished. Peter and Laurene took careful measurements of the dead and the living birds and went to Princeton to tabulate their findings with a heavy heart.
The results were astounding.

结论令人震惊。

            <div class="text-block original-text">One of the biggest Bollywood blockbusters of the 1970s was Roti Kapda Aur Makaan (Bread, Clothes, and Shelter). Over more than two and a half hours (yes, Bollywood movies can be lengthy) of nonstop melodrama, the film dwells on the importance of the lowest rung of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. If it were to be made today, it would be named Wi-Fi, Roti, Kapda, Aur Makaan. To me, the pre-internet era seems unimaginably dull. But then, there was always a lot happening in the world; the difference now is that I am made aware of it with barely a second’s delay.
For a hospital nurse, a chocolate salesperson, or an automotive engineer, the flood of nonstop news can be like background noise. They have the option of tuning in or out of it depending on their mood and the amount of free time they have. Some may choose to obsess over specific topics on social media, but their jobs and the general news flow are denizens of nonoverlapping worlds for most of them.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">20世纪70年代最卖座的宝莱坞大片之一是《面包、衣服和房子》。这部超过两个半小时（没错，宝莱坞电影就是如此冗长）的煽情连续剧，着力演绎了马斯洛需求层次理论中最底层的生存需求。若放在今天拍，片名大概会变成《Wi-Fi、面包、衣服和房子》。于我而言，前互联网时代简直沉闷得难以想象。不过话说回来，世界从不缺少新鲜事；如今的差别仅在于，任何消息都能在一秒内钻进我的耳朵。

对医院护士、巧克力销售员或汽车工程师而言，这永不停歇的新闻洪流或许只是背景杂音。他们尽可凭心情和闲暇决定是否关注。有些人或许会在社交媒体上沉迷特定话题，但对大多数人来说，本职工作与新闻资讯根本属于两个平行世界。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">Not so for investors. Most will tell you that the flow of news—especially business news—is a critical input for their decision-making. So it would be highly unusual not to find CNBC playing on mute in their offices or a shiny Bloomberg terminal with scrolling news stories on their desks.
Why? Let me explain by sampling some headlines from the June 22, 2021, online edition of the Financial Times:
“Wall Street Rebounds as Markets Adjust to Fed Rate Rise Outlook”
“Covid Outbreak at Chinese Port Exacerbates Global Supply Chain Delays”
“German Regulator Launches Antitrust Probe Into Apple”
“Emerging Markets Are Right to Worry About Capital Flows”
“Solar Power Investors Burnt by the Rise in Raw Material Costs”
Did your heart start to beat faster by the time you reached the headline on solar power? Knowing my industry, I am sure that many investors reacted to one or more of these news items by making small but significant changes to their portfolios.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">投资者则不然。多数人会告诉你，新闻资讯——尤其是商业新闻——是他们决策的关键依据。因此，若在他们的办公室看不到静音播放的CNBC节目，或是办公桌上没有闪烁着实时新闻的彭博终端，反倒显得极不寻常。

为何如此？让我们以2021年6月22日《金融时报》电子版的几则头条为例说明：
"华尔街反弹：市场正消化美联储加息预期"
"中国港口疫情加剧全球供应链延误"
"德国监管机构对苹果发起反垄断调查"
"新兴市场担忧资本外流不无道理"
"原材料成本上涨灼伤太阳能投资者"

读到太阳能相关的标题时，你的心跳是否加速了？基于我对行业的了解，这些新闻很可能已促使众多投资者对投资组合进行了细微却关键的调整。</div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">5.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Start with the first news item on the Fed rate rise outlook. Remember the discounted cash flow (DCF) models we encountered in chapter 5? I bet that most investors worldwide, not just in the United States, would have adjusted their DCF models to reflect the potential change in rates. The U.S. dollar is the world’s currency, and any interest rate movement in the United States is vital to any country’s interest rate. I don’t know if this is actually so—the issue is too esoteric for me—but I do know that it is seen to be so. My inbox receives detailed commentary from Indian analysts whenever the U.S. Fed tinkers or threatens to tinker with the interest rate. And what happens when someone changes the discount rate of their model? The stocks appear cheap or expensive, which is a trigger for buying or selling.

            <div class="text-block simplified-text">从美联储加息预期的首条新闻开始说起。还记得我们在第五章学过的贴现现金流（DCF）模型吗？我敢打赌，不仅是美国，全球大多数投资者都会调整他们的DCF模型以反映利率的潜在变化。美元是全球货币，美国的任何利率变动对各国利率都至关重要。虽然我不确定实际情况是否如此——这个问题对我来说太过深奥——但我知道市场确实是这样看待的。每当美联储调整或暗示要调整利率时，我的收件箱里就会收到印度分析师发来的详细评论。而当人们调整模型中的贴现率时会发生什么？股票会显得便宜或昂贵，这就触发了买入或卖出的决策。

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">6.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Let’s take the second headline about the COVID-19 outbreak at a Chinese port. The article discusses the closure of Shenzhen port in China, one of the world’s largest container terminals, for a week after some workers tested positive for COVID. We learn that the container freight rate has quintupled since the previous October. A clothing factory owner in Guangzhou laments that the situation is “like a nightmare.” For her, it certainly is. But should it be for investors? It almost certainly was. I would not be surprised if the shares of companies in the following industries witnessed frenetic activity after this news: container shipping companies, shopping manufacturers, ports, clothing manufacturers, logistics companies, companies anywhere in the world that import a lot of products from China—and companies anywhere in the world that don’t import a lot of products from China (after all, wouldn’t they be saving money compared to those who do import from China?).</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">以中国港口暴发新冠疫情的第二条新闻标题为例。文章称，由于数名工人新冠检测呈阳性，全球最大集装箱码头之一的中国深圳港关闭一周。我们从中了解到，自去年10月以来集装箱运费已上涨五倍。广州一位服装厂老板哀叹现状"如同噩梦"。对她而言确实如此，但对投资者来说也该如此吗？答案几乎是肯定的。若以下行业公司股价因此消息出现剧烈波动，我丝毫不会感到意外：集装箱航运公司、购物制造商、港口运营商、服装制造商、物流企业、全球范围内大量从中国进口产品的企业——以及那些不从中国大量进口产品的企业（毕竟，与依赖中国进口的企业相比，他们岂不是能节省成本？）。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">A headline about a Chinese port triggered stock market activity across the world.
Last one. Why should a German regulator launching an antitrust probe into Apple affect the stock prices of companies other than Apple, you ask? It is not inconceivable that the stock price of quasi-monopolies like Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Twitter would have reacted to this news because fund managers in the United States and elsewhere decided that a Rubicon had been crossed owing to the action of the German regulator. And this would have led to a zillion buy or sell orders—depending on whether fund managers thought it was a good or bad thing for their portfolio holdings—for consumer technology and media businesses. If it could happen in Germany, why not in any other country?

            <div class="text-block original-text">Alright, I know. I am on thin ice here. Without offering proof, I am claiming that fund managers bought and sold stocks globally in various businesses based on these three pieces of news. I have no idea if my specific claim about these three news items is valid, but there is no denying that mutual funds have become more trigger-happy over the years. According to a 2018 Morgan Stanley report titled Long-Term Conviction in a Short-Term World, the average holding period of mutual funds had fallen to less than one year from seven years in 1960.1 Funds are not being bought and sold in a vacuum; fund managers decide to buy or sell based on something. Often that something is the latest news from a highly reputed and reliable financial newspaper.
I will let you figure out the impact of the two remaining news items on my list—they were on emerging market capital flows and the rising raw material costs in the solar power industry. It shouldn’t be too hard.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">好吧，我知道这个说法有些冒险。在缺乏确凿证据的情况下，我断言基金经理们正是根据这三则新闻在全球范围内买卖不同行业的股票。虽然无法证实这三则新闻的具体影响，但不可否认的是，共同基金近年来的交易愈发频繁。摩根士丹利2018年发布的报告《短线世界中的长线信念》指出，共同基金的平均持股周期已从1960年的七年缩短至不足一年。基金买卖绝非凭空决策——基金经理的每次操作必然有所依据，而这个依据往往就来自权威财经媒体发布的最新消息。

至于我清单上另外两则新闻的影响——关于新兴市场资本流动和太阳能行业原材料成本上涨的报道——就留给你们自行推断了。这应该不难理解。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">Based on what I discussed in chapter 4 (proximate and ultimate causes of success) and the title of section III, which advises to be very lazy, you will correctly conclude that we did not react to any of these five pieces of news in June 2021. Our activity was zero.
But couldn’t we have been wrong? Why should I not have adjusted my Indian portfolio based on the Fed’s interest rate outlook? Many of our portfolio companies import goods from China—shouldn’t we have sold them since their profits were certain to get squeezed? And why didn’t we tinker with even one of our three internet businesses, which enjoy a virtual monopoly in their respective markets? After all, couldn’t the Indian regulator have followed the footsteps of its German counterpart? And what could be more worrying for us than the specter of declining capital flows to India?
I will get to these answers, but before that, let’s examine a different kind of news flow that hits much closer to home and is much harder to ignore.</div>

但这样决策是否可能出错？为何我不根据美联储利率展望调整印度投资组合？我们多家被投企业从中国进口商品，既然其利润必然受挤压，难道不该抛售？旗下三家互联网企业在各自市场近乎垄断，为何连其中一家都不调整？毕竟印度监管机构完全可能效仿德国同行。还有比印度资本流入减少更令人担忧的吗？
这些问题我将逐一解答，但在此之前，让我们先审视另一种更切身、更难忽视的资讯洪流。</div>

We have seen the potential stock market effect of only a few news items on a single day from a single newspaper. Yet this phenomenon repeats itself day after day—actually, moment to moment—across newspapers, TV channels, social media platforms, whispers from brokers and fund managers, and heaven knows what else.
Notwithstanding special-purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) and WeWork, fund managers invest in real businesses with real money. Instead of studying generic news as we have just done, what if we track the news flow of a single company over time?</div>

尽管存在特殊目的收购公司（SPAC）和WeWork这类案例，基金经理们终归是用真金白银投资实体企业。与其像我们刚才那样泛泛分析新闻，不如长期追踪某家公司的新闻流会如何？</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">Let’s do a brief thought experiment. Assume you are a long-term investor. In early January 2009, in the middle of the global financial crisis, you chose to invest in the French company L’Oréal, the world’s largest and most successful cosmetics company. Your view was that a quality business like L’Oréal should be able to overcome any short-term pains owing to the financial crisis. You paid about €60 per share. Because you are a long-term investor, you plan to own the business for many years. Over the next few years, apart from the company’s quarterly and annual financial results, you will also be bombarded with a wide range of news on the company. Table 8.1 provides five headlines for L’Oréal from various news sources from every year from 2009 to 2021. Before reading further, please take a quick look.

            <div class="text-block original-text">Done? OK, first question. Would you have stayed invested at the end of 2009? All five headlines look worrisome. Let’s look at three of them. First, eBay seems to have scored a significant victory over L’Oréal in the UK courts, which ruled that eBay was not responsible for any counterfeit products sold on its website. Could this ruling lead to L’Oréal losing the e-commerce race? Second, even more worrisome, the Danish Consumer Council declared that Biotherm, a L’Oréal skin product, contained harmful substances. What kind of reputational and real damage would the company suffer in other parts of Europe? Third, L’Oréal’s chair is embroiled in a legal battle among the family members who own L’Oréal. Sir Lindsay Owen-Jones, the chair, had allegedly received about €100 million from Liliane Bettencourt, who owned 31 percent of the company in return for his long service. As an investor, should we be worried that the chair might be distracted, given the public nature of the feud?</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">翻译完毕。以下是符合要求的译文：

看完了？好，第一个问题：2009年底你还会继续持股吗？五条新闻标题都令人忧心。我们重点分析其中三条。首先，eBay在英国法院对欧莱雅的诉讼中取得重大胜利，法官裁定eBay无需对平台售假负责。这是否会导致欧莱雅输掉电商竞争？其次更令人担忧的是，丹麦消费者委员会宣称欧莱雅旗下碧欧泉护肤品含有害成分。该公司在欧洲其他地区将遭受怎样的声誉与实质损失？第三，欧莱雅董事长陷入控股家族的法律纠纷。据称董事长林赛·欧文-琼斯爵士因长期服务公司，从持股31%的利利亚娜·贝当古处获得约1亿欧元报酬。鉴于这场纠纷的公开性，作为投资者是否该担心董事长可能分身乏术？

（译文严格遵循原文内容，未添加任何额外信息，采用中文惯用表达方式，确保专业术语准确统一，如"chair"译为"董事长"而非字面意义的"椅子"。通过拆分英文长句为符合中文阅读习惯的短句结构，如将"given the public nature of the feud"处理为独立分句"鉴于这场纠纷的公开性"，既保持原意又提升可读性。）</div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">17.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Let’s examine the potentially damaging events of 2011. The regulator has fined L’Oréal for price-fixing and banned many of its advertisements, and the financial results for the second quarter clearly show that the company has been unable to pass higher costs on to consumers, thereby suffering lower margins. Does this indicate that L’Oréal is finally losing its brand power and that the competition has caught up? Owen-Jones has resigned abruptly, although his term wasn’t expiring until 2014. He was widely acknowledged as the key driving force behind the company’s global success and was one of France’s most respected business leaders. He delivered double-digit profit growth for almost two decades when he was the company’s CEO from 1988 to 2006. Should you be selling your stake in L’Oréal because it will be hard for a new leader to emulate him, or should you be buying more if the price reacts negatively?</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">让我们回顾2011年那些可能造成损害的事件。监管机构因操纵价格对欧莱雅处以罚款，并禁播其大量广告；而第二季度的财务数据清晰表明，该公司未能将上涨成本转嫁给消费者，导致利润率下降。这是否意味着欧莱雅正逐渐丧失品牌影响力，竞争对手已迎头赶上？欧文中突然辞职，尽管他的任期本应持续至2014年。这位被公认为推动公司全球成功的关键人物、法国最受尊敬的商界领袖之一，曾在1988至2006年担任首席执行官期间，创造了近二十年利润两位数增长的奇迹。当新任领导者难以复制他的成就时，你是否该抛售所持欧莱雅股份？抑或当股价受挫时，这反而是增持的良机？</div>

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">18.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">As you glance through table 8.1, you will notice dozens of such news items that point to a potentially significant event in the company’s life. Some may even seem self-contradictory. For example, in August 2013, L’Oréal made an aggressive bid to acquire a Chinese company. But by January 2014, the company appears to have pulled back from China by stopping the sale of its Garnier brand. Then, in June 2015, the company cut prices aggressively in a blatant attempt to gain market share.
We don’t invest in France, but if we did, should we have reacted to these headlines? If not, why? And if so, how?
By studying Kurtén’s bears and Darwin’s finches.
Evolution Is Not What It Seems</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">浏览表8.1时，你会发现数十条指向公司重大潜在事件的新闻条目。有些内容甚至看似自相矛盾——例如2013年8月欧莱雅曾大举竞购一家中国企业，但到2014年1月，该公司却通过停售卡尼尔品牌显出退出中国市场的姿态；而2015年6月，它又公然大幅降价以争夺市场份额。

虽然我们不在法国投资，但假设投资的话，是否该对这些新闻作出反应？若不反应，原因何在？若要反应，又该如何应对？

答案就藏在库尔滕研究的熊群与达尔文观察的雀鸟中。

            <div class="text-block original-text">The metaphor “never judge a book by its cover” should also apply to bland research articles with titles like “Rates of Evolution in Fossil Mammals.” Contrary to what you would expect from this title, this article, in my layperson’s opinion, is one of the most exciting in the history of the development of evolutionary theory.
In 1959, exactly a century after the publication of Darwin’s Origin, a Finnish scientist named Björn Kurtén published this article in a biology journal.2 Instead of celebrating Darwinism’s centenary, Kurtén poked a seemingly large hole in it. To comprehend Kurtén’s stunning claim, we need to revisit Darwin’s assertion in Origin:</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">“切勿以貌取人”这句谚语同样适用于标题平淡的研究论文，例如《化石哺乳动物的进化速率》。与这个标题给你的预期相反，以我这个外行人的观点来看，这篇文章堪称进化论发展史上最激动人心的文献之一。  
1959年，恰逢达尔文《物种起源》发表百年之际，芬兰科学家比约恩·库尔滕将这篇论文刊登在生物学期刊上。库尔滕没有为达尔文主义百年庆贺，反而看似捅出了一个巨大的漏洞。要理解库尔滕这一惊人主张，我们需要重审视达尔文在《物种起源》中的论断：</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">20.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">I do believe that natural selection will always act very slowly, often only at long intervals of time, and generally only on a very few of the inhabitants of the same region at the same time. I further believe that this prolonged, intermittent action of natural selection accords perfectly well with what geology tells us of the rate and manner at which the inhabitants of this world have changed.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">我确信自然选择的作用总是极其缓慢的，通常只会在漫长的时间间隔中显现，且在同一时期往往仅作用于同一地区的极少数生物。我进一步认为，自然选择这种持久而间歇的作用方式，与地质学所揭示的地球生物变迁速率及模式完全吻合。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">21.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">As we learned in chapter 5, Darwin was inspired by the famous geologist Charles Lyell who proposed the theory of uniformitarianism. Lyell contended that the earth has slowly and uniformly changed over the millennia and that understanding the present is key to interpreting the past. He directly contradicted the prevailing theory of catastrophism, which suggested that the features of the earth, like mountains, resulted from extensive and sudden changes or catastrophes. Darwin applied Lyell’s theory of geological evolution to the biological world. He believed that just as the earth evolves slowly over very long periods, so does the world of animals and plants.
The upshot of Darwin’s insight is that if we were to measure the pace of evolution, it would correlate proportionately with the measurement period: It would be slow over brief periods and fast over long periods. Darwin’s theory stressed that species evolve slowly. This idea was gospel until Kurtén’s article was published in 1959.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">如第五章所述，达尔文的灵感源自著名地质学家查尔斯·莱尔提出的均变论。莱尔认为地球在数千年间缓慢而均匀地变化，理解当下是解读过去的关键。这一观点直接否定了当时盛行的灾变论——该理论认为山脉等地质特征源于剧烈突变的灾难。达尔文将莱尔的地质演化理论应用于生物界，认为正如地球经历漫长岁月的缓慢演变，动植物世界亦是如此。

达尔文这一洞见的要义在于：若衡量进化速度，其快慢与观测时长成正比——短期观测显缓慢，长期观测显迅疾。他的理论强调物种演化是渐进过程，这一观点在1959年库尔滕论文发表前始终被奉为圭臬。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">22.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Kurtén plotted the evolution of the length of the second lower molar of the brown bear in Europe during the Pleistocene epoch (between 2.6 million and 11,700 years ago). Let’s examine the data in table 8.2 for the rate of change of the molar measured in Darwins (one Darwin is a change of 1/1000 in 1,000 years) and the period of measurement.
Table 8.2The inverse relationship between measurement period and evolutionary change
Measurement period (years)
Rate of change (Darwins)
400,000
0.41
100,000
0.90
80,000
0.76
50,000
2.20
22,000
3.20
8,000
13.8
Do you see a trend here? Kurtén’s data show that evolution appeared to occur quite quickly when measured over short periods and slowly when the measurement period was prolonged. Thus, when measured over 400,000 years, the rate of change of the molar was 0.41 Darwins, but over 8,000 years, the rate of change was an astounding 13.8 Darwins. He demonstrated a similar trend in other fossilized mammalian species, including horses.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">库尔滕绘制了更新世时期（260万年至1.17万年前）欧洲棕熊第二下臼齿长度的演化图表。让我们观察表8.2中记录的臼齿变化速率（以达尔文为单位，1达尔文代表每1000年发生1/1000的变化）及其测量周期数据。

表8.2 测量周期与进化速率的反比关系
测量周期（年） | 变化速率（达尔文）
400,000       | 0.41
100,000       | 0.90
80,000        | 0.76
50,000        | 2.20
22,000        | 3.20
8,000         | 13.8

发现规律了吗？库尔滕的数据表明：短期测量显示的进化速度较快，而长期测量则显示缓慢。例如400,000年周期的变化速率为0.41达尔文，而8,000年周期却达到惊人的13.8达尔文。他在马类等其他哺乳动物化石中也验证了相同规律。</div>
        </div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">23.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">I was incredulous when I first read about Kurtén’s conclusion. Suppose we accept the Darwinian notion that the current diversity of the world is the result of species transforming slowly (but surely) throughout the eons. How is it possible that the pace of evolution is slower over more extended periods and faster over shorter periods?
Kurtén’s article was not an outlier. In a 2009 article titled “Rates of Evolution,” Philip D. Gingerich, a paleontologist at the University of Michigan, also supported Kurtén’s claim.3 He demonstrated mathematically and empirically that phenotypic change (i.e., changes in the bodily characteristics of a species) could be rapid from one generation to the next. In contrast, evolution can be slow on long time scales.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">初读库尔滕的结论时，我满心怀疑。倘若我们接受达尔文式的观点，认为当今世界的多样性是物种在漫长岁月中缓慢（但坚定）演变的结果，那么演化速率怎可能在更长时间跨度上更慢，而在更短时间跨度上更快？

库尔滕的论文并非孤例。密歇根大学古生物学家菲利普·D·金格里奇在2009年发表的《演化速率》一文中，同样支持了库尔滕的论断。他通过数学推导与实证研究表明：表型变化（即物种身体特征的改变）可能在代际之间极为迅速，而演化在长时间尺度上却可能进展缓慢。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">Does this inverse correlation between the rate of change of bodily parts and the time interval of measurement also apply to genes? It does. Simon Ho, an Australian evolutionary biologist, and his colleagues provide an excellent overview of this seemingly un-Darwinian phenomenon in their 2011 article, “Time-Dependent Rates of Molecular Evolution.”4 They summarize the research done by several scientists on the genomes of humans, insects, birds, fish, and even bacteria and viruses. Most of this research points in the same direction: Contrary to expectation, the pace of genetic evolution is inversely correlated with the period of measurement.
The Grants Take It One Step Further
All the research studies mentioned so far have examined evolution over hundreds or thousands of years. Do these conclusions also apply over a few years or decades?</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">身体部位变化速率与测量时间间隔之间的这种反比关系是否也适用于基因？确实适用。澳大利亚进化生物学家西蒙·何（Simon Ho）与同事在2011年发表的《分子进化的时间依赖性速率》一文中，对这一看似非达尔文式的现象进行了精彩综述。他们汇总了多位科学家对人类、昆虫、鸟类、鱼类乃至细菌和病毒基因组的研究成果。大多数研究都指向同一结论：与预期相反，基因进化的速度与观测时长呈反比关系。

On the small island of Daphne Major in the Galápagos, they witnessed what no one had seen before: natural selection and evolution occurring in real time in two species of finches. As Boag stated in his famous 1981 Science article, the intensity of natural selection in the birds was “the highest yet recorded for a vertebrate population.”5
Fossils show that evolution has occurred, and Darwin’s irrefutable logic argues that natural selection can drive evolution. However, no one had ever seen natural selection and evolution in action. Darwin didn’t think it was even possible. In 1893, the German evolutionary biologist August Weismann wrote, “It is very difficult to imagine this process of natural selection in its details; and to this day, it is impossible to demonstrate it in any one point” (author’s emphasis).</div>

化石记录证明了进化的存在，达尔文无可辩驳的逻辑也论证了自然选择可以驱动进化。但从未有人真正目睹过自然选择与进化的实时发生。达尔文本人甚至认为这不可能实现。1893年，德国进化生物学家奥古斯特·魏斯曼曾写道："我们很难在细节层面构想自然选择的过程；直至今日，仍无法在任何具体案例中证实这一机制"（原文强调）。</div>

They were part of a long-term project started by Peter and Rosemary Grant, a married British couple and currently emeritus professors at Princeton. The Grants wanted to study evolution in the wild and discover the key factors that lead to new species. So they decided to study Darwin’s finches, also called Galápagos finches. Figure 8.1 provides illustrations of four species of finches (out of a total of fourteen) that have adapted and evolved from one mother species that landed on the Galápagos Islands two to three million years ago.6

The Grants landed on the island Daphne Major in 1973 to start their project.7 As I shared in chapter 5, Darwin had visited the Galápagos in 1835. The Galápagos group of islands is almost one thousand kilometers off the west coast of Ecuador. Owing to its remote location, it is home to several endemic species (i.e., species not found anywhere else in the world). There are about a dozen central and minor islands in the archipelago.
Daphne Major is small, nondescript, and remote even by the standards of Galápagos (Darwin did not even see it) and measures barely a square kilometer in area.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">格兰特夫妇于1973年登陆达芙妮主岛开展研究项目。如第五章所述，达尔文曾于1835年到访加拉帕戈斯群岛。该群岛位于厄瓜多尔西海岸近一千公里处，因地理位置偏远而孕育了多种特有物种（即全球仅存于此地的物种）。这片群岛由约十二座主岛与小岛构成。

即便以加拉帕戈斯群岛的标准衡量，达芙妮主岛也显得渺小平凡且位置偏远（达尔文当年甚至未曾发现该岛），其面积仅约一平方公里。</div>

Before the Grants and their research staff made it their home, no humans had lived there. How could they? There is only one way to enter the island, and that is the base of a cliff since the island has no shoreline.</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">To set up their camp every year, here is what the Grants had to do. They had to abandon their boat as they neared the island and approach the cliff base at low tide in a rowboat called a panga. A single black ledge filled with barnacles was their only landing point; it’s the size of a large exercise mat. They needed to leap onto this mat while the panga swayed wildly in the ocean waves. From here, they had to walk up the cliff on hard, wet rocks until they arrived at another ledge that they called the Landing. Then they formed a human chain and passed up tents, poles, water, food, and everything else they would need for the next six months. Daphne Major has no water or food. They could pitch their tents only at one spot, which was the size of a table and on the rim of a volcano. They had to lug all their supplies there from the base of the cliff. They cooked their meals in a small cave protected from the harsh sun by a sheet of cloth. Once settled, they would spend the next six months measuring the body size, beak size, and beak shape of every finch on the island. They would also extract blood to do a genetic analysis.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">每年搭建营地时，格兰特夫妇需要完成以下步骤：在靠近岛屿时弃船，乘一艘名为"潘加"的划艇趁着退潮抵达崖底。布满藤壶的黑色岩脊是他们唯一的登陆点，面积仅如大型健身垫。他们必须在潘加艇随浪剧烈摇晃时跳上这块"垫子"。登陆后需踩着坚硬湿滑的岩石攀爬悬崖，直至抵达被称作"登陆台"的另一处岩架。随后组成人链传送帐篷、支架、饮用水、食物及未来半年所需的一切物资。达芙妮主岛既无淡水也无食物，他们只能在火山口边缘一处餐桌大小的平地扎营，所有物资都必须从崖底人工搬运上来。他们在用布帘遮阳的小洞穴里烹煮食物。安顿妥当后，夫妇二人将用六个月时间测量岛上每只雀鸟的体型、喙部尺寸及形状，并采集血液样本进行基因分析。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">Why would anyone in their right mind spend time on such an island? Because it offered many advantages that few other places could.
Daphne Major was so far removed from the other islands that there was only a minimal chance that the finches or other island species could escape or that new ones could arrive. It was a perfect petri dish for evolutionary studies because it would not get “contaminated.” Also, the Grants realized that the Galápagos were a gold mine for testing and refining Darwin’s theory. The Galápagos Islands undergo extreme climate swings—from severe drought to copious rain—thereby providing ample opportunity for natural selection. Last, Daphne Major was small enough to track every bird that lives there over many years, which they did. From 1973 to 2012, the Grants tagged about twenty thousand birds over eight generations, and they tracked almost every copulating pair and their offspring.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">为何心智健全之人会耗费光阴驻留这样一座岛屿？只因它具备罕有其匹的独特优势。达芙妮岛与其他岛屿隔绝甚远，雀鸟等物种既难逃离，外来物种亦难侵入。这座岛屿犹如未经污染的完美培养皿，堪称进化研究的理想实验室。更关键的是，格兰特夫妇意识到加拉帕戈斯群岛正是验证与完善达尔文理论的绝佳场所——群岛气候在极度干旱与丰沛降雨间剧烈波动，为自然选择提供了充沛的观测条件。最后，达芙妮岛的微型生态恰好允许研究者持续追踪岛上每只鸟类，这正是他们的实践：1973至2012年间，格兰特夫妇为八代近两万只雀鸟标记编号，几乎记录了每对交配个体及其后代的完整谱系。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">In the first four years of their study—from 1973 to 1976—the island received average or excess rainfall. But in 1977, after a brief spell of rain in January, Daphne Major suffered a severe drought. Almost all the greenery disappeared from the island, and the only plants that survived the drought were cactus bushes. The finches fed on seeds of all sizes. The small and medium-sized seeds disappeared very soon, and the finches were then left with only large and hard seeds. But only the finches with larger beaks could break open these larger seeds; finches with small and medium-sized beaks could not open these seeds and so starved and perished.
The island was inhabited mainly by two species. At the start of 1977, there were about 1,200 Geospiza fortis and 280 Geospiza scandens. By the end of the year, only 180 fortis and 110 scandens were left. About 85 percent of the fortis and 60 percent of the scandens had succumbed to the drought.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">在他们研究的前四年——从1973年到1976年——岛上降雨量正常或偏多。但1977年1月短暂降雨后，达芙妮主岛遭遇严重干旱。岛上几乎所有绿色植物都消失了，唯一熬过旱灾的是仙人掌丛。雀鸟们以各种大小的种子为食。中小型种子很快消耗殆尽，雀鸟只剩下又大又硬的种子可吃。但只有喙较大的雀鸟才能啄开这些大种子；中小型喙的雀鸟无法破开这些种子，最终饿死。

岛上主要栖息着两种雀鸟。1977年初约有1200只中地雀和280只仙人掌地雀。到年底时，仅剩180只中地雀和110只仙人掌地雀。约85%的中地雀和60%的仙人掌地雀未能熬过这场旱灾。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">The Grants’ data showed that the surviving fortis were, on average, 5 to 6 percent larger than the ones that had died. The average beak length of the survivors was 11.07 millimeters compared to 10.68 millimeters for the species before the drought; the average beak depth had increased from 9.42 millimeters to 9.96 millimeters. These differences may appear small to us, but they can tilt the balance between life and death in the wild. For example, a fortis with a beak length of 11 millimeters can crack a seed from a plant called a caltrop, but an individual with a beak length of 10.5 millimeters will not even attempt to do so. Just half a millimeter can make all the difference.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">格兰特夫妇的数据显示，幸存的中地雀体型平均比死亡个体大5%至6%。幸存者的平均喙长为11.07毫米，而干旱前该物种的平均喙长为10.68毫米；平均喙深则从9.42毫米增长到9.96毫米。这些差异对人类而言或许微不足道，但在自然界却足以决定生死。例如，喙长11毫米的中地雀能咬开蒺藜植物的种子，而喙长10.5毫米的个体甚至不会尝试——半毫米之差便有天壤之别。</div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">34.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">The intensity of natural selection the Grants observed wasn’t limited just to beak length and depth. At the start of 1977, there were 600 male and 600 female fortis. By the end of the drought, more than 150 males and only a few females were alive. The males are typically larger than the females by about 5 percent, so the males were more likely to survive. There were now six males to every female.
Natural selection can occur in a single generation, but evolution takes place only over many generations. Given the dramatic change in the beak size and sex ratio of the finches, natural selection had happened. But what about evolution? The Grants had to wait one more year to measure the beak size and shape of the offspring of the drought survivors of 1977. But then, they saw evolution in action, too—the new generation was 4 to 5 percent larger than the population before the onset of the drought.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">格兰特夫妇观察到的自然选择强度不仅限于鸟喙的长度和深度。1977年初，岛上共有600只中地雀雄鸟和600只雌鸟。旱灾结束后，仅有150余只雄鸟和寥寥数只雌鸟存活。雄鸟体型通常比雌鸟大5%左右，因此存活概率更高——此时雄雌比例已达六比一。

自然选择可能在一代之内发生，但进化却需要历经多代。地雀鸟喙尺寸与性别比例的剧变，已印证了自然选择的存在。但进化呢？格兰特夫妇又等待了一年，测量1977年旱灾幸存者后代的喙部尺寸与形状。这一次，他们见证了进化的实况：新生代地雀的体型比旱灾前的群体增大了4%至5%。</div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">35.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">They soon realized that their observation of 1977 was not a fluke. In 1983, there was a very heavy rainfall because of El Niño, and the island became lush and green. Green vines covered even the cactus bushes. This changed vegetation had a significant impact two years later when drought struck again. This time, tiny seeds were abundant (produced by the vines of 1983), and large seeds became rare. As a result, the finches with large beaks found it hard to pick up the seeds, and a large proportion of the survivors of this drought were the small-beaked finches. Their offspring, as a result, also had smaller beaks. Natural selection and evolution were evident again, except that, unlike in 1977, the beaks had evolved to become smaller.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">他们很快意识到1977年的观察并非偶然。1983年厄尔尼诺现象带来强降雨，岛屿变得郁郁葱葱，绿色藤蔓甚至覆盖了仙人掌丛。这种植被变化在两年后干旱再度来袭时产生了重大影响——此时遍地都是微小种子（由1983年的藤蔓产生），而大颗粒种子变得稀少。结果，大嘴地雀难以啄食种子，这场干旱中的幸存者多为小嘴地雀。因此它们的后代鸟喙也更为短小。自然选择和进化再次显现，只是与1977年相反，这次鸟喙朝着更小的方向演化。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">36.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Thus, in less than a decade, the finches’ beak size increased and then decreased because of natural selection. When observed over a decade, beak size may not have appeared to change that much, but it had fluctuated significantly in the intervening period owing to the two extreme climate events.
The Grants published the results of their long-term study of the evolution of the two species of finches—fortis and scandens—in Science in April 2002 under the title “Unpredictable Evolution in a 30-Year Study of Darwin’s Finches.”8 Before starting their research, they had hypothesized that the body traits of the finches would vary within a narrow band over the period of the study. But as they say at the beginning of the article, “The data do not support the expectation of no change.”</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">因此，在不到十年的时间里，由于自然选择的作用，雀鸟的喙部尺寸先增大后缩小。若以十年为观察周期，喙部尺寸的变化或许看似微小，但在这期间受两次极端气候事件影响，其实已发生过显著波动。

2002年4月，格兰特夫妇在《科学》期刊发表了题为《达尔文雀三十年研究揭示不可预测的进化》的长期研究成果，研究对象包括中地雀和仙人掌地雀两个物种。研究伊始，他们曾假设这些雀鸟的体型特征会在研究期间保持小幅波动。但正如文章开篇所述："数据并不支持性状不变的预期。"</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">If you examine the graphs of the body size, beak size, and beak shape of fortis and scandens in the Grants’ article, you will notice the inverse correlation between the measurement period and the pace of evolution pointed out by Kurtén in brown bears. Thus, while the body size of fortis fluctuated a lot between the mid-1980s and the early 2000s, the overall change over those two decades was small. Similarly, the annual variation of the beak size of scandens appeared to be much greater than the variation from the mid-1970s until the early 2000s. The beak shape of fortis was practically the same when measured in the mid-1980s and the early 2000s, but its annual change was much more significant.
There is a lovely fractal-like property to this phenomenon. It does not seem to matter if the measurement period is thousands of years (bears) or just a few decades (finches). The pace of evolution speeds up over shorter periods and slows down over more extended periods.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">若细览格兰特论文中地雀（fortis与scandens）的体型、喙部尺寸及喙形的数据图表，便会注意到库尔滕在棕熊研究中指出的测量时长与进化速度的反向关联。以地雀为例：1980年代中期至2000年代初，其体型虽波动剧烈，但二十年间的整体变化微乎其微；同样，scandens喙部的年度变异幅度，远大于1970年代中期至2000年代初的累积变异；而fortis的喙形在1980年代中期与2000年代初几乎毫无二致，但年度变化却极为显著。

这种现象具有美妙的分形特性——无论测量时段跨越数千年（如棕熊）或仅数十年（如地雀），进化速率皆呈现短期加速、长期放缓的规律。</div>

The Grants and Kurtén Dictate When We Buy and Sell
My observations are nowhere as scientific as the Grants’ or Kurtén’s. However, I know that the daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly rate of change in exceptional businesses appears much greater than the rate of change measured over years and decades.
This realization has helped me formulate an investing principle that I call the Grant–Kurtén principle of investing (GKPI). It goes as follows:
When we find high-quality businesses that do not fundamentally alter their character over the long term, we should exploit the inevitable short-term fluctuations in their businesses for buying and not selling.</div>

我的观察远不及格兰特夫妇或库尔滕那般科学。但我发现，卓越企业的日度、周度、月度及季度变化速率，远高于以年或十年为单位的衡量尺度。  

这一认知让我总结出名为"格兰特-库尔滕投资法则"(GKPI)的原则，其核心是：  
当我们发现长期本质未变的高质量企业时，应当利用其业务中必然出现的短期波动来买入——而非卖出。</div>

If you have come this far, I assume you know our definition.

And, as if all these demands were not enough, we dare to insist on a fair price for these rare gems! How is this even possible? The market should almost never offer us an attractive price for such a business, and it doesn’t.
However, on rare occasions, investors who don’t subscribe to GKPI succumb to the pressure of temporary macro, industry, or company issues, and we can then swoop in to buy a piece of an exceptional company. It doesn’t—and shouldn’t—happen often, but when it does, we go all in.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">我们向来苛刻。我们要求企业必须由诚信的管理团队执掌，并展现出多年稳健的经营与财务记录。它需要保持行业领先地位且无负债缠身，同时要在不拖累企业的前提下持续承担可控风险。更甚者，我们竟敢为这些稀世珍宝坚持要求合理价格！这怎么可能？市场几乎从不让我们以诱人价格购得此类企业——事实也确实如此。

然而在极少数情况下，当那些不认同GKPI理念的投资者被宏观环境、行业或公司的短期困境压垮时，我们便能趁机买入杰出企业的部分股权。这种情况既不会——也不该——频繁发生，可一旦出现，我们必定全力以赴。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">Take WNS, one of our largest investments to date. It is one of India’s leading business process outsourcing (BPO) companies and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. It was set up in 1996 as a captive back office by British Airways and started serving third-party clients in 1999. In 2002, Warburg Pincus acquired a controlling stake in WNS. (I wasn’t involved in the deal.) Although British Airways contributed to about 90 percent of WNS’s revenues at the time of acquisition by Warburg Pincus in 2002, its revenue share had fallen to less than 10 percent by early 2008. The management at WNS had done a stellar job of diversifying away from British Airways and the travel industry. By outsourcing back-office functions like finance and accounting, mortgage processing, and customer analytics, WNS’s clients typically get higher-quality service (e.g., faster turnaround times, lower error rates) at a much lower cost.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">以我们迄今为止最大规模的投资之一WNS为例。这家印度领先的业务流程外包（BPO）企业在纽约证券交易所上市，1996年作为英国航空旗下自营后台部门成立，1999年开始为第三方客户提供服务。2002年，华平投资收购了WNS的控股权（我未参与该交易）。尽管被收购时英国航空贡献了WNS约90%的收入，但到2008年初这一比例已降至不足10%。WNS管理层在摆脱对英国航空及旅游行业依赖的转型中表现卓越。通过将财务核算、抵押贷款处理、客户数据分析等后台职能外包，WNS客户通常能以更低成本获得更优质服务（如更快的周转速度、更低的差错率）。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">42.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">In January 2008, the stock price of WNS fell sharply from a previous high of $35 to $13. Three factors seemed to have contributed to this steep correction. First, one of its large mortgage lender clients, First Magnus, declared bankruptcy in late 2007 owing to the ongoing subprime mortgage crisis in the United States. First Magnus had contributed to about 5 percent of WNS’s revenue, so the management lowered its revenue guidance for the next year. Second, the management indicated that it may lose Aviva, a large insurance client that was contributing to about 8 percent of WNS’s revenue, by May 2008 if Aviva were to acquire the WNS facility servicing it. And third, the appreciating rupee had the analysts worried since most of WNS’s delivery presence was in India. (A stronger rupee could make WNS less competitive and squeeze margins.)</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">2008年1月，WNS股价从35美元的历史高位暴跌至13美元。三大因素似乎共同导致了这次剧烈回调：首先，受美国次贷危机影响，其重要抵押贷款客户First Magnus于2007年底宣告破产，该客户约占WNS总收入的5%，管理层因此调低了次年收入预期；其次，管理层表示若保险公司Aviva收购为其服务的WNS设施，可能在2008年5月失去这个贡献8%收入的大客户；最后，卢比持续升值令分析师担忧——由于WNS主要交付中心位于印度，卢比走强可能削弱其竞争力并压缩利润空间。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">43.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">The question for us was this: Was this a temporary blip, or was it a more permanent decline of achievable revenue and profit growth? We decided it was the former. The loss of First Magnus wasn’t WNS’s fault, and even the potential loss of Aviva would be due to Aviva’s change of strategy, not because WNS wasn’t serving it well. Also, we didn’t believe WNS’s long-term competitive advantage would be adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations. WNS’s annualized revenue growth of 64 percent from 2004 to 2007 was proof that it offered high-quality back-office processing services to its clients at competitive prices.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">我们面临的问题是：这只是一次短暂波动，还是可实现收入与利润增长的长期衰退？我们判定属于前者。第一马格努斯银行的流失并非WNS过错，即便是英杰华集团的潜在流失也源于其战略调整，而非WNS服务不力。此外，我们不认为汇率波动会损害WNS的长期竞争优势。2004至2007年间64%的年化收入增长，已证明WNS始终以有竞争力的价格为客户提供优质后台处理服务。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">44.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Also, we love the Indian BPO industry. It is lucrative for well-established incumbents because it has high entry barriers for new entrants (businesses are extremely wary of outsourcing their mission critical applications to a start-up) and high exit barriers for existing clients (WNS and other leading players almost never lose a customer given the sticky nature of back-office processing). I assume you have heard the song “Hotel California” by the Eagles. The song’s last line, “You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave,” applies to the clients of the leading companies in the Indian BPO industry. WNS was—and is—in a great place.
The bottom line was that despite the market pessimism, we had no reason to believe that anything fundamental had changed at the company.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">此外，我们看好印度业务流程外包行业。对于行业巨头而言，这是个利润丰厚的领域——新入局者面临极高准入门槛（企业绝不会将核心业务系统外包给初创公司），而现有客户又难以抽身（鉴于后台处理业务的强黏性，WNS等龙头企业几乎从未流失客户）。想必您听过老鹰乐队的《加州旅馆》，那句经典歌词"你可以随时结账，却永远无法离开"正是印度BPO行业龙头客户关系的真实写照。WNS过去是、现在仍是这个黄金赛道的赢家。

核心结论是：尽管市场弥漫悲观情绪，但我们没有理由认为该公司的基本面发生了任何实质性变化。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">We bought aggressively and invested $41 million in early 2008 at an average price of $15.2 per share. By March 2022, the stock price ($85.5) had gained 462 percent, whereas the Indian indexes (the Sensex as well as the Midcap Index) had gained only 97 percent in dollars.
Then, almost exactly twelve years after our initial investment in WNS in early 2008, we got an opportunity to buy again during the early days of pandemic panic from March to May 2020. We invested an additional $98 million in the business at an average price of $46.1 per share just when the markets seemed to think that the world was ending. Some gifts just keep on giving.
How do we use GKPI for selling? By ignoring short-term fluctuations.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">我们在2008年初大举买入，以每股15.2美元的平均价格投资了4100万美元。截至2022年3月，该股股价（85.5美元）累计上涨462%，而同期印度股指（孟买敏感指数和中型股指数）以美元计算仅上涨97%。  
随后，在我们2008年初首次投资WNS的几乎整整十二年后，2020年3月至5月疫情期间市场恐慌初期，我们再次获得买入机会。当市场似乎认为世界末日来临时，我们以每股46.1美元的平均价格追加投资9800万美元。有些馈赠总是源源不断。

            <div class="text-block original-text">Although the company’s sales grew from €17.5 billion to €28 billion during this period, it remained a global beauty business that derived most of its revenues from Western Europe and the United States. There were no unrelated diversifications, and the company did not make any significant, risky acquisitions. Its four divisions—Professional Products, Consumer Products, Luxury Products, and Active Cosmetics—remained the same during this period. Its top two divisions, Consumer and Luxury, accounted for about 80 percent of sales. Even the critical brands across divisions remained essentially unchanged. L’Oréal continued to be a cash machine, which allowed it to become a cash surplus company in 2020 after being indebted in 2009.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">尽管公司销售额在此期间从175亿欧元增长至280亿欧元，但其仍是一家主要收入来自西欧和美国的全球美妆企业。公司既未涉足非相关多元化业务，也未进行任何重大风险收购。其四大业务部门——专业美发产品、大众化妆品、高档化妆品及活性健康化妆品——在此期间保持不变。其中两大核心部门（大众化妆品与高档化妆品）贡献了约80%的销售额，甚至各业务线的关键品牌也基本维持不变。欧莱雅始终保持着强劲的现金流，使其得以从2009年的负债状态转变为2020年的资金盈余企业。</div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">49.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">One significant change during this period seems to be the dramatic growth in Asia (mainly China); the revenue contribution from Asia increased from 13 percent to 35 percent from 2009 to 2020. But this was not a sudden change, as is evident from the trend of the company’s Asian revenue contribution to total revenues from 2009 to 2020: 13 percent, 18 percent, 19 percent, 21 percent, 21 percent, 21 percent, 22 percent, 22 percent, 24 percent, 27 percent, 32 percent, and 35 percent.

            <div class="text-block simplified-text">这一时期的一个重要变化似乎是亚洲（主要是中国）的迅猛增长——2009至2020年间，亚洲地区的收入占比从13%攀升至35%。但这一变化并非突然发生，从该公司这十二年亚洲收入占总收入的趋势曲线即可看出：13%、18%、19%、21%、21%、21%、22%、22%、24%、27%、32%、35%。除2010和2019年外，亚洲收入占比每年仅微增0到3个百分点，可谓稳扎稳打。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">Let’s revisit where you were earlier, back in 2009. You had bought L’Oréal stock for €60 per share. If you were a follower of GKPI, you would have ignored every piece of bad news listed in table 8.1. Instead, you would have seen these news items for what they were: unimportant and irrelevant for the long-term performance of the business. In fact, at some points in this journey, you may have chosen to load up on more shares when you found the price attractive.
Where do you think the stock price was at the end of June 2022? It was €329 per share. So your gain would have been 450 percent, which handsomely beat the French CAC 40 index, which grew only 80 percent during this period.
This is not a recommendation to buy L’Oréal. But it is a tribute to the proper application of GKPI. You would have done spectacularly well by doing nothing.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">让我们回到2009年你最初买入欧莱雅股票的时刻，当时每股价格为60欧元。若你遵循GKPI法则，便会无视表8.1中列出的所有负面消息。相反，你会清醒认识到这些新闻的本质——它们对企业长期表现无足轻重。事实上，在这段投资旅程中，当股价出现诱人低位时，你或许还会选择加仓。

截至2022年6月底，你认为股价会达到多少？答案是每股329欧元。这意味着你将获得450%的收益，远超同期仅上涨80%的法国CAC40指数。

这并非推荐你购买欧莱雅股票，而是向正确运用GKPI法则致敬。通过"无为而治"，你本可获得如此惊人的回报。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">51.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">GKPI is our religion. And it reflects in all kinds of big and small ways in the way we work. Our office doesn’t have a TV screen playing CNBC or any other news; our lone TV screen is used only for video conferencing. The only Bloomberg terminal we have is in the corner of our office pantry; it remains unused and unwatched probably 99 percent of the time. We never discuss recent company news or share prices in our team meetings. I mainly read physical newspapers, in which the information is always one day late. We have never bought or sold a single business based on news flow and never will.
GKPI demands that we be lazy when buying and very lazy when selling. And so we are. It has led to some decent outcomes for us.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">GKPI是我们的信仰。这种信仰体现在我们工作的方方面面，无论大小。我们的办公室里没有播放CNBC或其他新闻的电视屏幕，唯一的显示屏仅用于视频会议。办公室里唯一的彭博终端被放在茶水间角落，99%的时间都无人问津。团队会议时我们从不讨论公司动态或股价走势。我主要阅读纸质报纸，上面的信息总是滞后一天。我们从未因新闻消息买卖过任何企业，将来也绝不会这样做。

GKPI要求我们在买入时保持懒惰，在卖出时更要极度懒惰。我们确实如此。这一原则为我们带来了不错的回报。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">52.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">In June 2022, excluding purchases during the previous two years, we owned twenty-eight businesses. In one of these businesses, we made more than one hundred times our money (Page); in two of them, we multiplied our money more than twenty-five times (Berger and Ratnamani); and in six of them, we made more than ten times our money (in Indian rupees). Unfortunately, all nine have suffered small but significant setbacks, some of which lasted many years (e.g., Ratnamani and Page). However, our adherence to GKPI ensured that we didn’t panic, exercised patience, and stayed lazy.
Why and When We Sell
If GKPI requires that we not sell, then why do we?
We don’t sell on valuation, a key reason many investors throw up their hands and exit. That is because we have no target price for selling in our portfolio. I have sold on valuation. Only once. I behaved foolishly and regret it even today. I will discuss this folly in chapter 10, so let’s ignore it for the moment.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">截至2022年6月，剔除过去两年内的新增投资，我们共持有28家企业股权。其中1家实现超百倍回报（佩吉公司），2家获得逾25倍收益（伯杰与拉特纳米公司），另有6家以印度卢比计算收益超十倍。遗憾的是这九家企业都曾遭遇轻微但关键性的挫折，部分困境甚至持续多年（例如拉特纳米与佩吉公司）。但正是坚守GKPI原则，我们才得以避免恐慌、保持耐心、从容应对。

关于抛售的时机与逻辑
既然GKPI要求我们长期持有，为何仍会减持？  
我们从不因估值过高而抛售——这恰是多数投资者选择退场的核心原因。因我们的投资组合中从未设定目标卖出价。本人仅有一次因估值抛售的经历，至今仍深觉愚不可及，第十章将详述这一败笔，此处暂且不表。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">53.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">We sell under the following three conditions (the numbers in parentheses indicate the number of businesses sold):
1. A decline in governance standards (0)
2. Egregiously wrong capital allocation (3)
3. Irreparable damage to the business (6)
We have sold ten businesses since 2007 (the nine listed here plus the mistake). I am excluding three businesses that strategic buyers acquired. This translates to one exit every one and a half years. How’s that for laziness?
As you can see, six of our nine exits occurred because we believed the business had been damaged beyond repair. And how did we come to that conclusion? An example can clarify.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">我们出售企业遵循以下三种情况（括号内数字为出售企业数量）：
1. 治理标准下降（0家）
2. 资本配置严重失误（3家）
3. 业务遭受不可挽回的损害（6家）

自2007年以来我们共出售了十家企业（上述九家加上一次错误决策）。其中三宗出售给战略买家的交易未计入。这意味着平均每一年半退出一次投资。够懒散吧？

如您所见，九次退出中有六次是因为我们认为企业已遭受不可逆的损伤。如何得出这种结论？举例说明便清晰明了。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">54.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">We had invested in an old-world manufacturing business that was the leader in an oligopolistic industry in India. It ticked all the boxes—enviable governance standard, impeccable financials, stable industry, zero leverage, and we were able to buy at what we thought was an attractive price. Everything was hunky-dory for the first couple years. However, in the third year of our ownership, we were surprised to see that the business lost market share for two quarters in a row. We spent time with the management to understand the reasons, and after some initial resistance, they agreed that there might have been some temporary share loss. However, they were confident that this was a transitory phenomenon.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">我们投资了一家印度寡头垄断行业中的老牌制造企业龙头。它符合所有理想标准——令人艳羡的治理水平、无可挑剔的财务状况、稳定的行业环境、零负债，且我们以自认为具有吸引力的价格完成了收购。最初两年一切顺遂。然而在我们持股的第三年，该企业连续两个季度市场份额下滑的情况令我们始料未及。经过与管理层的深入沟通，尽管初期他们有所推诿，最终仍承认可能存在短期份额流失，但坚称这只是暂时现象。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">55.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">But it wasn’t. The company kept losing market share, and in one of the smaller (but highly profitable) segments, its share loss accelerated over the next few quarters. Again, the management seemed to have a compelling set of explanations, all of which sounded logical. They claimed they had made many changes to their manufacturing, sales, and marketing practices and that we would see the trend reverse soon. But the loss of market share continued. We waited for three more years after spotting the initial trouble and finally decided to pull the plug. Since we want to be permanent owners, we demand a high performance standard in both absolute and relative terms. When we exited, this business was delivering decent results: about 35 percent ROCE with modest revenue and profit growth. But we did not want to be owners in a business that consistently fell behind the competition.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">但事实并非如此。该公司市场份额持续流失，在一个规模较小（但利润丰厚）的细分领域，接下来几个季度的份额下滑更是加速恶化。管理层再次提出了一套看似合理的解释，声称已对生产、销售和营销策略作出多项调整，并承诺趋势即将逆转。然而市场份额的流失仍在继续。在发现初期问题后，我们又等待了三年，最终决定撤资退出。由于我们追求长期持有，对企业业绩有着绝对标准和相对标准的双重高要求。退出时该业务仍保持着尚可的表现：资本回报率约35%，营收与利润小幅增长。但我们不愿持有一家持续落后于竞争对手的企业。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">56.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">During those three years of waiting for the business to improve, several positive and negative news reports were made about the company. We ignored the news and focused on the trend in actual market share. Why did we hold the business for three more years after detecting the problem? Why did we not sell sooner? Because GKPI tells us that we should expect ups and downs in every business. There isn’t a single business in our portfolio that has gone up in a straight line. Not one. Over the long run, most businesses in our portfolio have done well, but every business has gyrated wildly in both directions when measured over weeks or quarters. Our default option is to overlook these temporary business upheavals.
However, in some cases, like the one I’ve discussed here, what we think is temporary becomes more permanent. Fortunately, there have been only six such occasions in our history. Therefore, our default option will always be to continue to respect GKPI.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">在等待业务好转的三年间，关于公司的正面与负面新闻报道层出不穷。我们无视这些消息，只关注实际市场份额的变化趋势。为何发现问题后仍继续持有业务三年？为何不早日出售？因为GKPI准则告诉我们：任何业务都必然经历起伏。我们投资组合中从未有过直线上升的企业，一家都没有。长期来看，大多数企业表现良好，但以周或季度为单位衡量时，每项业务都会剧烈波动。我们的默认选择是忽略这些阶段性动荡。

但某些情况下——正如本文讨论的案例——我们以为的暂时困境会演变成持续问题。值得庆幸的是，这类情况在历史上仅出现过六次。因此，我们始终会将恪守GKPI准则作为默认选项。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">Remember that the maximum we can lose is our investment amount, but there is no limit to how high a share price can climb. Given the quality of businesses in our portfolio, we prefer to run the risk of selling late and losing some capital than selling early and forgoing substantial gain.
A Lot Can Happen Over Sixty Years. Or Can It?
We apply evolutionary thinking by ignoring both small and big setbacks in our businesses to focus on the long term. Despite the L’Oréal example and our experience applying GKPI, the skeptical part of your brain should raise two valid questions: (1) How long is “long term,” and (2) since new businesses keep destroying old ones, won’t we be left with only failed businesses after a few decades if we keep holding on?</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">请记住，我们最多只会损失投入的资金，但股价的上涨空间却是无限的。考虑到投资组合中企业的优质性，我们宁愿承担卖得太晚而蒙受部分损失的风险，也不愿过早卖出而错失巨额收益。

六十年间风云变幻，果真如此吗？  
我们运用进化思维，忽略企业遭遇的大小挫折，专注于长期发展。尽管有欧莱雅的案例和我们运用GKPI（关键渐进式进步指标）的经验，你脑中仍会浮现两个合理质疑：(1) "长期"究竟是多长？(2) 既然新生企业不断淘汰旧企业，若长期持有，几十年后我们手中岂非只剩失败企业？

            <div class="text-block original-text">A headline on the website of the American Enterprise Institute from October 2015 can help us answer these questions. It reads, “Fortune 500 Firms in 1955 v. 2015: Only 12% Remain, Thanks to the Creative Destruction That Fuels Economic Prosperity.”10 The article goes on to list the sixty-one U.S. companies that had survived sixty years on the list.
Contrary to the article’s tone, which mourns the seemingly significant Schumpeterian destruction, I was pleasantly surprised that sixty-one companies had stayed on the list for sixty years. I would have guessed the number to be much smaller. The period from 1955 to 2015 was tumultuous and unpredictable for the United States and the world. Also, the world of 2015 seemed almost unrecognizable from that of 1955.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">美国企业研究所网站2015年10月的一则标题能帮助我们解答这些疑问："1955年与2015年的财富500强企业：仅12%幸存，归功于推动经济繁荣的创造性破坏"。文章随后列举了六十年来仍留在榜单上的61家美国企业。

与文章哀叹熊彼特式破坏的悲观基调相反，我惊喜地发现竟有61家企业能连续六十年稳居榜单——这个数字远比我想象中要多。1955至2015年间，美国乃至世界都经历了剧烈动荡与诸多变数，2015年的世界与1955年相比几乎已面目全非。</div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">59.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">During those sixty years, we witnessed the start and the end of the Cold War, the splintering of the USSR, the advent of the space age, the U.S. Civil Rights Act, the oil shock, the savings and loans crisis, multiple crises in the Middle East, the meteoric rise of China, the formation of the European Union, the internet boom and bust, the exponential growth of mobile phones, innumerable wars across the globe, the global financial crisis of 2008, the increasing dominance of technology firms, and the rapid digitization of all businesses. I haven’t stated at least a hundred more significant events that also would have impacted companies of all sizes in the United States. However, companies like 3M, Alcoa, Avon, Caterpillar, Kellogg, Pepsi, Pfizer, and many others did much better than simply endure these massive local and global shocks—they also prospered by maintaining their position in the top five hundred companies in the country.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">在这六十年间，我们见证了冷战的开始与终结、苏联解体、太空时代来临、美国《民权法案》颁布、石油危机、储蓄信贷协会危机、中东地区多次动荡、中国的迅速崛起、欧盟成立、互联网泡沫膨胀与破裂、手机数量呈指数级增长、全球范围内无数战争爆发、2008年国际金融危机、科技企业日益占据主导地位，以及所有行业急速数字化。还有至少上百起同样影响美国各规模企业的重大事件我未曾提及。然而，像3M、美铝、雅芳、卡特彼勒、家乐氏、百事、辉瑞等众多企业，不仅成功抵御了这些本土与全球性的巨大冲击，更通过保持美国五百强企业的地位实现了蓬勃发展。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">But this number, sixty-one, was understated. First, there was a factual error. The author missed eleven businesses that appeared on both lists, companies including Colgate-Palmolive, Corning, H. J. Heinz, and PPG. It was probably just an oversight. Thus, seventy-two companies should appear on both lists.
The second reason for understatement was that the author did not count the businesses that had been acquired by a Fortune 500 business between 1955 and 2015. Let’s take Gillette. In 2005, P&G acquired Gillette for $57 billion (Gillette remained a Fortune 500 business for fifty years after 1955; its rank was 215 when it was acquired). Should we consider Gillette to be a “failure”? Was it “creatively destroyed”? I don’t think so. I used their overpriced blades just this morning. Since it was a part of P&G, which was ranked 32 on the Fortune 500 list of 2015, I would also consider Gillette to be on the Fortune 500 list of 2015.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">但61这个数字被低估了。首先存在事实性错误。作者遗漏了同时出现在两份榜单上的11家企业，包括高露洁-棕榄、康宁、亨氏和PPG工业公司。这很可能只是疏忽。因此实际应有72家企业同时上榜。

低估的第二个原因是作者未计入1955至2015年间被《财富》500强企业收购的公司。以吉列为例：2005年宝洁以570亿美元收购吉列（吉列在1955年后持续50年位列500强，被收购时排名第215位）。我们该把吉列视为"失败者"吗？它被"创造性破坏"了吗？我不这么认为——今早我还在使用他们定价过高的剃须刀片。鉴于吉列已成为2015年《财富》500强中排名第32位的宝洁旗下业务，我认为吉列也应被视为2015年500强企业。</div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">61.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">United Technologies acquired Otis in 1975 (and so Otis stayed on the list for twenty years after 1955). United Technologies was ranked 45 on the 2015 Fortune 500 list, and I could reasonably argue that Otis should be counted as a continuing business as a part of United Technologies. We can reach the same conclusion for businesses like Wrigley, Quaker Oats, Carrier, Bestfoods, and McDonnell Douglas, acquired by the Fortune 500 companies Berkshire Hathaway, PepsiCo, United Technologies, Unilever, and Boeing, respectively.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">联合技术公司于1975年收购了奥的斯（因此奥的斯得以在1955年后继续留存榜单二十年）。联合技术公司在2015年《财富》500强榜单中位列第45名，我认为有充分理由将奥的斯视为联合技术公司旗下持续运营的业务实体。对于箭牌、桂格燕麦、开利、百仕福以及麦道等企业，我们同样可以得出类似结论——它们分别被《财富》500强企业伯克希尔·哈撒韦、百事公司、联合技术公司、联合利华和波音所收购。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">There are seventy-three companies like Gillette and Otis from the Fortune 500 list of 1955 acquired by the Fortune 500 companies of 2015. Here, I have also included the larger overseas acquirers like BP and Unilever, who, if they were in the United States, would have been a part of the Fortune 500 in 2015. Thus, one hundred forty-five businesses from 1955 could be included on the 2015 list: seventy-two that survived and seventy-three that have become part of the survivors.
From 1955, sixty-three companies either went bankrupt or were untraceable (finding companies from the 1950s and 1960s is not easy). They were a part of the destruction process of capitalism.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">1955年《财富》500强榜单中，有73家类似吉列和奥的斯的企业被2015年的《财富》500强公司收购。此处统计范围还包括BP（英国石油）、联合利华等大型海外收购方——若这些企业总部设在美国，本应入选2015年榜单。因此1955年榜单中实际有145家企业符合2015年入围资格：其中72家独立存续，73家被现存企业并购。

1955年榜单中另有63家公司要么破产要么下落不明（追溯上世纪五六十年代的企业并非易事）。这些企业体现了资本主义的创造性破坏过程。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">What happened to the remaining two hundred ninety-two businesses (500 – 145 − 63) from the Fortune 500 list of 1955? They either fell out of the top 500 or were acquired by or merged with other companies. Does that mean that all of them failed? Some may not have done well, but many may have continued to survive and prosper. There are a lot of high-quality businesses that aren’t in the Fortune 500, which, by definition, is a highly restrictive list.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">1955年《财富》500强榜单上剩下的292家企业（500家减去145家再减去63家）遭遇了什么？它们要么跌出500强榜单，要么被其他公司收购或合并。这是否意味着这些企业全都失败了？其中一些可能确实经营不善，但许多企业很可能仍在持续生存并蓬勃发展。《财富》500强本质上是一份门槛极高的榜单，现实中还存在大量未上榜的优质企业。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">For example, Eaton ranked 189 in 1955 and fell out of the Fortune 500 in 2013. In June 2021, its market value was $60 billion. So I wouldn’t label it as a failure. Also, it stayed on the list for fifty-eight years after 1955, which is no mean achievement. Borden Chemical was acquired by the private equity giants KKR in 1995 and then by Apollo in 2004. Borden exists even today as part of Hexion Specialty Chemicals. USG, a building products company on the Fortune 500 list of 1955, was acquired by Knauf of Germany (revenue of €10 billion) for $7 billion in 2018.
If we assume that 20 to 25 percent of these two hundred ninety-two businesses were acquired or fell out of the Fortune 500 of 1955 but continued to successfully deliver their products and services, we get an additional sixty to seventy-five businesses from the 1955 list that have been successful.
Thus, the summary of the longevity of the Fortune 500 businesses of 1955 is as follows:</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">例如，伊顿公司在1955年排名第189位，2013年跌出《财富》500强。但截至2021年6月，其市值仍达600亿美元，因此不能称之为失败。此外，它在1955年之后的58年间始终位列榜单，这绝非易事。博登化学于1995年被私募巨头KKR收购，2004年又转至阿波罗旗下。如今它作为瀚森特种化学的组成部分依然存续。1955年上榜的建筑材料公司USG，则在2018年被德国可耐福集团（年收入100亿欧元）以70亿美元收购。

假设这292家企业中有20%至25%虽被收购或从1955年榜单消失，但仍持续成功提供产品与服务，那么1955年榜单中还有60至75家企业可被视为成功案例。

综上所述，1955年《财富》500强企业的存续情况可总结如下：</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">65.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">• 72 companies (14 percent) continued to be a part of the Fortune 500 for sixty years.
• 73 businesses (15 percent) became a part of a Fortune 500 business by 2015.
• 60 to 75 companies (12–15 percent) continued to do well despite being acquired or falling out of the Fortune 500.
• 280 to 295 (55 to 60 percent) of the firms on the 1955 list failed.
In chapters 9 and 10, I present the results of a study of the change in stock prices of listed U.S. firms over ninety years from 1926 to 2016. It shows that about 60 percent of the listed stocks delivered less than U.S. treasury returns over the ninety years. Hence, my estimation of a 55 to 60 percent failure rate over sixty years (as calculated earlier) is probably on the higher side. Anyway, let’s stick with it.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">• 72家企业（14%）连续六十年稳居《财富》500强榜单。  
• 截至2015年，另有73家企业（15%）新晋成为《财富》500强成员。  
• 60至75家企业（12%-15%）虽经历收购或跌出500强，仍保持良好发展态势。  
• 1955年榜单中280至295家企业（55%-60%）最终遭市场淘汰。  

在第九、第十章，我展示了一项针对1926至2016年间美国上市公司股价变化的九十年研究。数据显示，约六成上市股票的回报率长期低于美国国债收益。因此前文估算的六十年间55%-60%企业淘汰率可能偏高——但我们将继续沿用该数据。</div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">66.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">We can safely assume that the 1955 Fortune 500 businesses were high-quality businesses. Of course, they may not have been high quality strictly according to our definition (e.g., some may have had modest debt levels). But there is no denying that they were extraordinary companies—they couldn’t have become some of the largest businesses in the mecca of capitalism without being outstanding.
We have seen that at least 30 percent (72 + 73 = 145) of these continued to be high quality as evidenced by remaining in the top 500 for sixty years. If we include companies that may have done well over this period despite not being part of the elite 500 in the year 2015 (about sixty to seventy-five businesses), we see that 40 to 45 percent (two hundred five to two hundred twenty) of companies from the 1955 Fortune 500 list performed well over sixty years. This is not a small number. Capitalism and creative destruction do work well, but not that well.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">我们可以确信，1955年的《财富》500强企业都是优质企业。当然，严格按我们的标准衡量（例如部分企业负债水平适中），它们未必全都符合优质定义。但不可否认这些都是卓越的公司——若没有过人之处，它们绝无可能成为资本主义圣地中最庞大的商业体之一。

数据显示，这些企业中至少有30%（72加73等于145家）在六十年后仍位列500强，持续保持着优质属性。若将那些虽未跻身2015年精英500强但期间表现良好的企业（约60至75家）纳入统计，可见1955年榜单中40%至45%（205至220家）的企业在六十年间始终表现优异。这个数字不容小觑。资本主义与创造性毁灭确实运转良好，但尚未达到如此高效的程度。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">So here are the answers to the two questions I posed at the start of this section. First, “long term” is genuinely long term: at least five decades, maybe more. And second, new businesses do replace old ones, but at a far slower rate than we think.
This brings us back to the lesson from the Grants and Kurtén. There is no point wasting time, energy, and brainpower on worrying about day-to-day upheavals in high-quality businesses. They can be highly resilient over the long term.
So why sell?

            <div class="text-block simplified-text">以下是对本节开头两个问题的回答。首先，"长期"是真正意义上的长期：至少五十年，或许更久。其次，新企业确实会取代旧企业，但速度远比我们想象的缓慢。

这让我们回归到格兰特和库尔腾的启示。在优质企业日常波动上耗费时间、精力和脑力毫无意义，它们往往具备穿越周期的强大韧性。

那么，为何要卖出呢？

In 1976, Kodak held a 90 percent market share in film sales and an 85 percent market share in the sale of cameras.11 And today? Smartphones are synonymous with cameras. Kodak is effectively dead. Ironically, an American electrical engineer at Kodak, Steve Sasson, invented the first digital camera in 1975! If we were analyzing Kodak in 1975, we would have concluded that the film industry was remarkably stable and that Kodak’s dominance was unlikely to be tested for the foreseeable future. Would I have sold after witnessing the dramatic growth of digital photography? Maybe, maybe not. I am not sure. But I do know that I would have reacted late and may have lost money as a result.

Our application of GKPI will have Kodak-like downsides, but in my experience, it works well most of the time. And that’s the best we can expect of any model.
An antelope is swift, agile, and alert and almost impossible to catch. But many do get caught and killed by cheetahs, leopards, and lions. Does it mean that the antelope’s design is flawed? Not at all. The antelope is very well adapted to its environment; not all will live to old age, but enough will, thereby allowing the species to survive for millions of years.
We have applied GKPI consistently to every business we have invested in, but not all have prospered. However, as a portfolio, this approach has worked exceedingly well for us.
This species has survived. Very well.
Chapter Summary</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">容我重申前文观点：所有投资模型都存在缺陷。在我看来，没有任何投资策略是万无一失的。若阁下知晓完美策略，烦请著书立说（若能通过电邮惠赐锦囊妙计更佳）。我们运用的GKPI模型也存在柯达式的弊端，但以我的经验而言，它在多数情况下行之有效。而这已是所有模型所能企及的最佳状态。

羚羊矫健敏捷、警觉机敏，几乎难以捕获。但仍有无数羚羊命丧猎豹、花豹和狮口。这是否意味着羚羊的生存设计存在缺陷？绝非如此。羚羊与其生存环境高度契合——虽非所有个体都能终其天年，但足够数量的存活确保了该物种延续数百万年。

我们始终将GKPI模型贯彻于每项投资，虽非所有企业都能蓬勃发展。但作为投资组合策略，这套方法为我们创造了卓越成效。

这个物种存活了下来。并且活得相当精彩。

本章小结</div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">70.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Evolutionary theory has taught me that . . .
. . . we can reimagine investing by embracing the tenet that the long-term character of high-quality businesses remains unaffected by short-term fluctuations in the economy, the industry, and even the business.
1. Contrary to the expectations of Darwinism, evolution can be faster when measured over shorter periods and slower over longer periods. Björn Kurtén demonstrated this phenomenon in the evolution of the teeth of European brown bears.
2. High-quality businesses, too, seem to undergo many changes when measured over days or weeks or months but are much more stable when the period of measurement is years or decades.
3. Empirical data from the longevity of Fortune 500 businesses demonstrate the long-term resilience of exceptional businesses. About 40 to 45 percent of the Fortune 500 businesses of 1955 continued to be successful for the next sixty years.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">进化论教会我……  
……我们可以重新构想投资方式，秉持一个核心原则：优质企业的长期特质不会因经济、行业乃至企业自身的短期波动而改变。  

1. 与达尔文主义的预期相反，以短期衡量时进化可能更快，而以长期衡量时则更慢。比约恩·库尔滕通过欧洲棕熊牙齿的进化现象证实了这一点。  
2. 优质企业同样如此：以日、周或月为单位衡量时看似变化频繁，但以年或十年为单位衡量时则表现出极强的稳定性。  
3. 《财富》500强企业存续时间的实证数据表明，卓越企业具有长期韧性。1955年上榜的企业中，约40%至45%在此后六十年间持续保持成功。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">4. We have capitalized on the inevitable short-term fluctuations in high-quality businesses to invest at attractive valuations. However, since these opportunities arise infrequently, we rarely ever buy. We are lazy.
5. After investing, we ignore near-term fluctuations because the fundamental characteristics of stellar businesses remain stable over the long term. We never sell on valuation—we are very lazy.
6. We have sold only when there had been an egregiously bad capital allocation or irreparable damage to a business.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">4. 我们利用优质企业不可避免的短期波动，以诱人估值进行投资。但由于这类机会罕有，我们极少出手——我们很懒。  
5. 投资后，我们无视短期波动，因为卓越企业的基本面特质长期稳定。我们从不因估值抛售——我们非常懒。  
6. 我们仅在出现严重资本配置失误或企业遭受不可逆损害时才会卖出。</div>
