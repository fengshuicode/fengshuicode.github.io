Charles Darwin, On the Origin of Species, chapter 3, “Struggle for Existence”
We have written in past reports about the disappointments that usually result from purchases and operation of “turnaround” businesses. Literally hundreds of turnaround possibilities in dozens of industries have been described to us over the years and, either as participants or observers, we have tracked performance against expectations. Our conclusion is that, with few exceptions, when a management with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for poor fundamental economics, it is the reputation of the business that remains intact.

我们曾在过去的报告中写过，收购并经营"困境反转"企业通常会带来失望。多年来，数十个行业中数以百计的潜在反转案例被推荐给我们，无论是作为参与者还是旁观者，我们都将实际表现与预期进行了对比。我们的结论是：当拥有辉煌声誉的管理层接手基本面糟糕的企业时，鲜有例外的是，最终保持完好的总是后者糟糕的声誉。

            <div class="text-block original-text">When you start reading a book on investing, I assume you want to be dazzled by the author’s brilliance. It won’t happen this time. I will begin this journey by profiling my stupidity.
After spending six years at McKinsey, I joined Warburg Pincus, a global private equity firm. After a few years of investing, I had learned the basics. Or at least I thought I had. They appeared simple: Invest in a high-quality entrepreneur running a growth business, and don’t overpay. I had lucked out on a couple of investments by then and so was flying high.
An entrepreneur running a successful business approached us to raise funds for expansion in the early 2000s. The business had a reasonable scale by Indian standards, and the company had many marquee clients, including one of India’s largest businesses. Notably, this company had also made inroads in overseas markets. It wasn’t common to see Indian companies outside the software services industry build a thriving export business in those days.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">当你翻开一本投资类书籍时，我猜你期待被作者的智慧光芒所震撼。这次恐怕要让你失望了。这段旅程的开篇，我将先剖析自己的愚钝。

在麦肯锡度过六年后，我加入了全球私募股权公司华平投资。经过几年投资实践，我自以为掌握了要诀。至少当时我是这么认为的。道理看似简单：投资由优秀企业家掌舵的成长型企业，并避免支付过高溢价。彼时我恰好押中了几笔成功投资，正沉浸在志得意满中。

二十一世纪初，一位成功企业家向我们寻求扩张资金。以印度标准衡量，该企业规模可观，客户名单中不乏知名企业，包括印度某行业巨头。更引人注目的是，这家公司已成功打入海外市场——在当时，非软件服务业的印度企业能建立蓬勃出口业务的案例实属罕见。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">I started our diligence process and did the usual: spent time with the founder and senior managers to understand their strategy and competitive differentiation, visited the company offices, talked to several customers in India and Europe, employed a firm specializing in forensic diligence to assess governance issues, hired the leading legal and accounting firms in India to perform diligence, and quizzed some industry experts on the company’s potential for growth and value creation. Everything was looking good, and I didn’t even have to haggle much on valuation or the legal documents.
I communicated my enthusiasm to my bosses and got the green light. The company raised $50 million—a big sum of money for a private equity investment in India at the time—and I enthusiastically led the investment. Warburg Pincus’s return on this investment? Zero. The firm lost all its money.
It was entirely my fault. I had screwed up. Big time.
Before Making Money, Learn Not to Lose Money</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">我启动了尽职调查流程，按常规步骤行事：与创始人及高管团队深入交流以理解其战略与竞争优势，实地考察公司办公场所，访谈印度及欧洲的若干客户，聘请法务审计专业机构评估公司治理问题，委托印度顶尖律所和会计师事务所进行合规审查，并向行业专家求证该公司增长潜力与价值创造空间。一切进展顺利，我甚至在估值和法律文件条款上都没费太多口舌。

我向高层表达了强烈看好，并获得投资许可。该公司最终融资5000万美元——这在当时印度私募股权投资领域堪称巨款——而我满怀热情主导了这次注资。华平投资从中获得了多少回报？零。这笔投资血本无归。

这完全是我的过错。我搞砸了，彻彻底底地搞砸了。

            <div class="text-block original-text">The next time you are in a bookshop, go to the section with investing books. Many of you below the age of thirty probably don’t know what a bookshop is. No worries—go to Amazon and type in “investment books.” Do you notice anything common across titles that scream things like Investing 101 or One Up on Wall Street or You Can Be a Stock Market Genius or New Era Value Investing? All of them are about how to make money. Duh. What else is an investing book supposed to teach? I hope to convince you that an essential prerequisite for making money is the ability not to lose money.
Almost everyone—and I say “almost” because this statement does not apply to my wife—makes mistakes. These errors fall into two broad categories: We do things we are not supposed to, and we don’t do things we are supposed to. For me, buying a hot fudge sundae at McDonald’s falls into the first category, and not keeping in regular touch with my school and college friends falls into the second.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">下次逛书店时，不妨去看看投资类书籍专区。三十岁以下的读者可能连书店是什么都不知道。别担心——打开亚马逊搜索"投资书籍"就行。你是否注意到《投资入门》《华尔街崛起》《股市天才养成手册》《新时代价值投资》这类书名有什么共同点？它们全都在教人如何赚钱。废话，投资类书籍还能教什么？但我想让你明白：赚钱的前提是学会不亏钱。

几乎所有人——我说"几乎"是因为我妻子例外——都会犯两种错误：一是做了不该做的事，二是没做该做的事。对我来说，在麦当劳买热巧克力圣代属于第一种错误，而疏于联系学生时代的朋友则属于第二种。</div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">5.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">All investors, too, make these two mistakes. Let me borrow from the field of statistics to describe them. The first kind—dubbed a type I error1 by statisticians who can never be blamed for being creative—occurs when I make a bad investment because I erroneously think it is a good one. It is the error of committing self-harm and is also called a false positive or error of commission. A type II error occurs when I reject a good investment because I erroneously think it is bad. This is the error of rejecting a potential benefit and can be termed a false negative or error of omission. Every investor, including Warren Buffett, makes these two errors on a regular basis. They either harm themselves or walk away from a great opportunity.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">所有投资者也都会犯这两种错误。让我借用统计学概念来描述它们：第一种错误——被缺乏创意的统计学家称为"第一类错误"——发生在我将劣质投资误判为优质标的时。这是自我伤害型错误，亦称假阳性或作为之过。第二种错误则发生在我将优质投资误判为劣质标的而拒绝时。这是错失潜在收益型错误，可称为假阴性或不作为之失。包括沃伦·巴菲特在内的每位投资者都会频繁犯这两类错误，他们要么伤害自身利益，要么与绝佳机遇失之交臂。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">6.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">As any statistician will tell you, the risk of these two errors is inversely related.2 Minimizing the risk of a type I error typically increases the risk of a type II error, and minimizing the risk of a type II error increases the risk of a type I error. Intuitively, this seems logical. Imagine an overly optimistic investor who sees an upside in almost every investment. This individual will make several type I errors by committing to bad investments but also will not miss out on the few good investments. On the other hand, an overly cautious investor who keeps finding reasons to reject every investment is likely to make very few bad investments but will lose out on some good investments.
Investors can’t have their cake and eat it, too! They need to choose to be more sensitive to making one type of error while living with the consequences of making more errors of the other kind. What should one do? What should you do?</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">任何统计学家都会告诉你，这两类错误的风险呈反比关系。降低第一类错误的风险通常会增加第二类错误的风险，反之亦然。从直觉上看，这很合理。想象一个过度乐观的投资者，他几乎在每项投资中都看到上涨潜力。这类人会因投资不良项目而多次犯第一类错误，但也不会错过少数优质投资。相反，一个过度谨慎的投资者若总是找理由拒绝每项投资，就可能极少做出错误投资，但也会错失一些良机。

投资者无法鱼与熊掌兼得！他们必须选择对某类错误更敏感，同时承受更多另一类错误的后果。该如何抉择？你又该怎么做？</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">In other words, which of the following investment strategies should you use: (1) making a lot of investments so as not to lose out on some good opportunities and, as a result, living with some failed investments, or (2) being highly selective to avoid making bad investments, thereby missing out on some good investments?
Let’s turn to evolution to seek the answer.
The goal of all animals is to survive for as long as possible, at least until they reproduce. In the animal world, everyone is both prey and predator. Yes, even we, the Homo sapiens. How are we prey? Remember COVID-19?
Let’s start with the prey. What would be a type I error for a prey animal? It would equate to inflicting sufficient harm on itself to compromise its fitness. Let me illustrate the case of an adult male deer to explore two kinds of type I errors.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">换言之，你应当采取以下哪种投资策略：（1）广泛投资以免错失良机，同时接受部分失败的投资；还是（2）精挑细选以避免糟糕的投资，但因此错过一些优质机会？  
让我们从进化论中寻找答案。  
所有动物的目标都是尽可能长久地生存，至少要活到繁衍后代。在动物世界中，每个个体既是捕食者也是猎物。没错，就连我们智人也不例外。我们如何成为猎物？还记得新冠肺炎吗？  
先从猎物的视角说起。对猎物而言，第一类错误意味着什么？这相当于因自身行为严重损害其生存适应性。以成年雄鹿为例，我将阐述两种第一类错误的情形。</div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">8.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">The first kind occurs when the deer is thirsty and is near a watering hole. Borne by instinct or experience or both, the deer knows that the watering hole could sound its death knell if a lion or leopard or crocodile is hiding, waiting for the opportunity of an easy meal. If the deer chooses to approach the watering hole, it slakes its thirst quickly and then moves away. And if it mistakenly draws near while a predator is ready and waiting, its life ends.
From the fossil record, we know that the deer that we see today evolved from ungulates about fifteen to thirty million years ago.3 They have survived millions of years amid ferocious predators by being very sensitive to making type I errors—errors of not being too careful. If they weren’t so, the species would have become extinct. Obviously, some individual deer do end up making the fatal error of commission by drinking at watering holes when predators are present, but the species as a whole has done remarkably well.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">第一种情况发生在鹿感到口渴且靠近水源时。出于本能或经验，抑或二者兼具，鹿知道水源可能成为它的丧钟——狮子、豹子或鳄鱼可能正潜伏其间，等待一顿轻松的美餐。若鹿选择靠近水源，它会迅速解渴后立即离开。而倘若它误入掠食者的伏击圈，生命便将终结。

化石记录显示，现今存活的鹿类是从约1500万至3000万年前的有蹄类动物演化而来。数百万年来，它们能在凶残掠食者的环伺中存活至今，正是由于对Ⅰ型错误（即不够谨慎的错误）极度敏感。若非如此，这个物种早已灭绝。诚然，某些个体鹿确实会犯下致命的行动错误——在掠食者潜伏时饮水丧命，但整个物种的存续堪称奇迹。</div>

A type I error of underestimating a threat could be the last error one of these animals makes.</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">The second kind of type I error that the deer can commit is seen in mating rituals. One fascinating sight in the wild for me, and dare I say for the female deer, is two adult male deer fighting over the exclusive control of a harem. Let me describe the mating behavior of the red deer found in many parts of Europe and in western and central Asia.4 The males are called stags, and the females hinds. The hinds live in groups called harems. Stags, armed with impressively large antlers, “fight” with one another to gain exclusive mating rights to the harem females. I have put the word “fight” in quotation marks because the stags rarely end up fighting physically. A type I error, or the error of commission, in this scenario would be the mistake of committing to fighting, thereby risking becoming injured or disabled. Although the prize of a harem is quite substantial, the stags show extreme sensitivity to the type I error by dueling very rarely. Here is how it works.</div>

This is because they don’t develop large and powerful antlers before this age. They could fight and take a chance, but none do. They could get seriously hurt, which could compromise their fitness for future mating or even their life.</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">When they do reach mating age, they approach the rutting grounds where hinds have gathered. But they don’t start fighting immediately. Scientists have observed that locking antlers is almost always the last resort, and a rutting stag will typically fight only five times during the three weeks of the rut. A series of highly choreographed rituals that serve to actively discourage physical contact precedes the locking of horns. When two stags challenge each other, one emits an impressive roar. The other then responds with seemingly equal vigor, because sound quality is a reliable indicator of the strength of one’s rival. The roaring may go on for more than an hour, with the number of roars peaking at three to four per minute. At this stage, based on the quality of roars, one of the stags typically withdraws.</div>

Yes, they threaten their opponent by walking! This parallel walking spectacle lasts many minutes during which time the rivals assess each other’s strength and physical condition from a distance of about two meters. During this period, they also thrash the vegetation and roar to appear more intimidating to their rival. Again, one may choose to withdraw at this stage. Only if both stags refuse to back down do they choose to clash antlers. To me, it seems more like a push-and-shove match. This “show”—most of these interactions don’t look like a real brawl—can last several minutes, at the end of which one stag admits defeat and runs away.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">若无法通过吼声判断彼此实力，它们便会进入"对决"的下一阶段——迈着僵直的腿平行踱步。没错，它们竟用行走来威慑对手！这场平行踱步的较量可持续数分钟，两头雄鹿相隔约两米远，借此评估对方的力量与体格。期间它们还会抽打草木并发出吼叫，以增强威慑力。此刻仍有一方可能选择退出。唯有当双方都不肯退让时，它们才会选择鹿角相抵。在我看来，这更像一场推搡比赛。这类"表演"——多数对决都称不上真正搏斗——可能持续数分钟，最终以一方认败逃窜告终。</div>

Stags have found great evolutionary success because at each stage of the contest, they minimize the error of committing self-harm: They do not even attempt to duel until they have big enough antlers, and even after acquiring their deadly weapons, they refuse to engage until they believe they have more than a fair chance of winning. Even their duel is not deadly—scientists have observed that only about 5 percent of rutting stags receive permanent injuries.
The bottom line is that the stags’ evolutionary success, at least in part, can be attributed to their instinct to preserve life and limb—to minimize the risk of committing a type I error.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">若这是一场人类拳击赛，观众早就因拳手们只顾嘶吼捶地而非互搏而掀翻场馆了！雄鹿之所以能取得显著的进化成功，关键在于它们在竞争的每个阶段都竭力避免自伤的错误：未长出足够硕大的鹿角前，它们甚至不屑于发起决斗；即便获得致命武器后，除非确信胜算颇高，否则也绝不轻易交战。就连它们的对决也非致命——科学家观测到仅约5%的发情期雄鹿会遭受永久性伤害。

归根结底，雄鹿的进化成功至少部分归功于它们保全生命的本能——这种本能将Ⅰ类错误（过度冒险）的风险降到了最低。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">But there is a significant trade-off to the approach of minimizing the risk of type I errors: the deer make many more type II errors. A type II error, or the error of omission, means avoiding a watering hole where no predator is waiting. Stags also too often withdraw from a rutting duel when they have a good chance of winning the harem. The cost is the lost opportunity to drink water or to mate.
In some cases, a type II error may turn out to be a fatal mistake. A thirsty deer may not be able to run quickly enough to escape a predator, and an overcautious stag may not get to pass his genes on to the next generation. But on average, making this trade-off in favor of reducing the number of errors of self-harm while tolerating a higher number of errors of rejecting potential benefit has worked quite well for the species.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">但这种将Ⅰ类错误风险最小化的策略存在显著代价：鹿会犯更多Ⅱ类错误。Ⅱ类错误又称"不作为错误"，表现为放弃没有捕食者埋伏的水坑，或是雄鹿在胜算较大时过早退出争夺配偶的决斗。其代价是丧失饮水或交配的机会。

某些情况下，Ⅱ类错误可能造成致命后果：脱水导致鹿无力逃脱追捕，过度谨慎的雄鹿可能错失延续基因的机会。但总体而言，这种以减少自害错误为主、容忍更多错失潜在收益错误的权衡策略，使该物种得以良好延续。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">Committing a type I error can be and has been deadlier than the loss of a single animal—it can lead to the extinction of an entire species. The flightless dodo bird, a native of Mauritius, was first spotted by sailors in 1507 and went extinct by 1681.5 Dodos were bigger than turkeys, and since they had no natural predators on the isolated island, they were not afraid of the human invaders. They committed the cardinal type I error—they did not avoid the humans when they should have—which led to their extinction.
Let’s now turn our attention to the predator. The predator, too, can make two types of error: It can commit itself to killing prey that turns out to be too dangerous or too large or too fast (type I error), or it can refrain from attacking prey that it could easily have killed (type II error).
Which error do you think a predator makes more often?</div>

现在让我们将目光转向捕食者。捕食者同样可能犯两种错误：它可能误判猎物的危险性而袭击体型过大、速度过快或过于危险的猎物（第一类错误），也可能错失本可轻易捕杀的猎物（第二类错误）。您认为捕食者更常犯哪种错误？</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">A cheetah is the fastest mammal on Earth and routinely achieves speeds of eighty to one hundred kilometers per hour while chasing prey.6 It sacrifices size and bulk for speed. A cheetah typically weighs 34 to 54 kilograms (75 to 120 pounds), which is significantly less than a lion, whose weight typically ranges from 170 to 230 kilograms (375 to 500 pounds). Hence, a cheetah usually preys on smaller animals like birds, rabbits, and small antelopes. A cheetah will never attempt to kill an adult water buffalo, a favorite prey of lions. The cheetah is simply trying to avoid getting hurt. Committing a type I error will lead either to death—water buffalos can turn on their hunters aggressively—or wasted energy—when a cheetah chases an antelope that was too far away to begin with. These mistakes, in turn, will lead to hunger and poorer hunting performance. For a cheetah mother, a type I error can also lead to the death of her offspring. The fact the species has been successful for eons demonstrates that cheetahs, as a species, have not committed too many type I errors. A type II error for a cheetah would mean not chasing prey it should have. This would leave the cheetah and maybe even her babies hungry, but they would all live to see another day.</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">Plants have been immensely successful evolutionarily: The first land plants appeared in the Ordovician era about 490 million years ago, and there are about 400,000 plant species found on our green planet.7 Unlike animals, the dramas of whose lives play out on African safaris, on wildlife TV channels, and in children’s books, plants may seem uninteresting, sedate, peaceful, and “inactive.” Nothing could be further from the truth. Look closely, and you will notice that the life of a plant, in many ways, is more exciting and action-packed than that of almost any animal. Paradoxically, this is because plants can’t move. If they are malnourished, they can’t move to a different location to feed; when attacked by herbivores, they don’t have feet to run or claws to fight back; when infected by pathogens, they can’t be offered treatment and cuddles like we humans can.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">植物在进化上取得了巨大成功：最早的陆生植物出现于约4.9亿年前的奥陶纪，如今这颗绿色星球上已发现约40万种植物。与动物不同——它们的生活戏剧在非洲草原、野生动物频道和儿童读物中轮番上演，植物看似无趣、沉静、平和且"静止"。但事实恰恰相反。仔细观察便会发现，植物的生命在许多方面比绝大多数动物更精彩纷呈。矛盾的是，这种精彩正源于植物的无法移动。当营养不良时，它们无法迁徙觅食；遭受食草动物侵袭时，它们没有逃跑的双足或反击的利爪；被病原体感染时，它们无法像人类那样获得治疗与抚慰。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">Plants can choose to commit resources broadly to two areas: defending against attacks or growing. As with deer and cheetahs, any error that significantly compromises life or fitness for a plant can be categorized as a type I error. Since the lack of a proper defense may prove fatal to a plant, a type I error, or an error of commission, occurs when the plant does not devote resources to protecting itself. A type II error occurs when a plant directs energy toward preservation when it should have invested in growth. This error of omission may not kill the plant but may compromise its ability to grow and reproduce relative to its competitors.
Ample evidence from nature suggests that plants avoid type I errors at the cost of committing more type II errors.8 Let’s examine how plants handle insect herbivores.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">植物会将资源集中分配至两大领域：防御侵袭或生长繁衍。与鹿和猎豹的情形类似，任何严重危及植物生存或适应性的失误都可归类为第一类错误。由于防御缺失可能导致植物死亡，当植株未将资源用于自我保护时，就会发生第一类错误（即过度作为之误）。若植物本应投资生长却将能量用于防御，则会产生第二类错误。这类不作为之误虽不致命，但会削弱其相对于竞争者的生长繁殖能力。

大量自然证据表明，植物会以犯更多第二类错误为代价来规避第一类错误。8 让我们观察植物如何应对植食性昆虫的侵袭。</div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">21.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">The first defense of plants against insects is physical structures like wax, thorns, and trichomes. A trichome is the layer of hairs on leaves, stems, and fruits and can be spiral, straight, hooked, or glandular. A dense trichome on a leaf impedes the movement of insects and their larvae, thereby reducing their ability to damage the leaf epidermis. Trichomes in glandular form can secrete poisonous or otherwise harmful chemicals like flavonoids and alkaloids, which repel insects. Some glandular trichomes can also trap insects.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">植物抵御昆虫的第一道防线是蜡质、尖刺和毛状体等物理结构。毛状体是覆盖在叶片、茎干和果实表面的绒毛层，形态可分为螺旋状、直立状、钩状或腺体状。叶片上浓密的毛状体能阻碍昆虫及其幼虫的活动，从而削弱它们破坏叶表皮的能力。腺体状毛状体可分泌类黄酮和生物碱等有毒或有害化学物质驱赶昆虫，部分腺体毛状体还能直接诱捕昆虫。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">22.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Producing and maintaining trichomes is metabolically expensive for a plant and prevents it from making additional leaves, stems, or fruits. Thus, when there are few or no insects, we should expect trichomes to be tiny or nonexistent. But when there is an insect attack, to reduce the risk of a type I error (erroneously investing in growth instead of preparing defenses), we should expect the plant to start making trichomes. And this is what we see. For example, scientists have observed that when adult leaf beetles attack the willow plant, new leaves grown after the attack develop higher trichome density. The willow plant redirects its resources from growth to defense as a result of sensing a predator. Trichome density also increases in other species like pepperwort and wild radish after an insect attack. When a butterfly species attacks a black mustard plant, the trichome density of the plant’s leaves increases, as does the production of pungent chemicals called glucosinolates. Within a few days or weeks following an insect attack, trichome density can increase from 25 to 1,000 percent!</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">对植物而言，生成并维持表皮毛需要消耗大量代谢能量，这会阻碍其生长出更多叶片、茎干或果实。因此，当昆虫稀少或不存在时，表皮毛往往微小甚至完全消失。但当遭遇虫害侵袭时，为避免犯下第一类错误（错误地将资源投入生长而非防御准备），植物便会开始大量生成表皮毛——这正是我们观察到的现象。例如科学家发现，当柳树遭受叶甲成虫侵害后，新生叶片的表皮毛密度会显著提升。柳树通过感知捕食者的存在，将资源从生长模式转向防御模式。类似现象也出现在胡椒草和野生萝卜等植物中：遭受虫害后，其表皮毛密度会明显增加。当某种蝴蝶侵害黑芥菜时，不仅叶片表皮毛密度上升，还会分泌更多具有刺激性气味的硫代葡萄糖苷。在虫害发生后的数天至数周内，植物表皮毛密度增幅可达25%至1000%！</div>

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">23.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">A plant’s defense mechanisms are not limited to trichomes, however. Lignin is a phenol compound that plays a vital role in a plant’s defense against insects. Lignin does two things to the leaves: It increases their toughness, thereby making them unpalatable, and it reduces their nutritional content. A leaf with excess lignin would be anathema for insects. Just as with trichomes, it is costly to produce lignin. Also as with trichomes, the plant ramps up its lignin production after an insect attack. In addition to lignin, compounds called flavonoids, tannins, lectins, and peroxidases also serve to reduce the risk of plants committing type I errors by directing resources to defense rather than growth.
What I have described are direct defenses against pests. But many plants also resort to indirect defenses, which are rarely seen in animals.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">然而，植物的防御机制并不仅限于腺毛。木质素是一种酚类化合物，在植物抵御昆虫侵害时起着至关重要的作用。木质素对叶片产生双重作用：一方面增加叶片的韧性，使其变得难以下咽；另一方面降低叶片的营养价值。木质素含量过高的叶片对昆虫而言无异于毒药。与腺毛类似，合成木质素需要消耗大量能量。同样地，植物在遭受虫害后会加速木质素的生成。除木质素外，黄酮类化合物、单宁酸、凝集素和过氧化物酶等物质也能通过将资源导向防御而非生长，帮助植物降低犯下"Ⅰ型错误"（即过度防御）的风险。

上述机制都属于针对害虫的直接防御。但许多植物还会采用间接防御策略——这种在动物界极为罕见的防御方式。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">24.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">An indirect defense works on the simple principle that “my enemy’s enemy is my friend.”9 It works simply—and beautifully—like this. When a plant senses an insect attack, it releases some chemical compounds from its leaves, flowers, and fruits into the atmosphere. These chemical compounds attract predators of the insects attacking the plants. For example, plants like lima beans and Arabidopsis release a chemical called methyl salicylate to attract insect predators like big-eyed bugs, ladybird beetles (commonly known as ladybugs), and green lacewings. This trick is not limited to the aerial parts of plants. Roots, too, can release chemicals that attract underground predators to underground pests. For example, when western corn rootworm threatens maize plants, the maize roots release a chemical that attracts a nematode species that preys upon the rootworm.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">植物的间接防御机制基于一个简单原理——“敌人的敌人即朋友”。这种防御方式运作简单而精妙：当植物感知昆虫侵袭时，会从叶片、花朵和果实释放特定化学物质到空气中。这些化合物能吸引以侵害植物昆虫为食的天敌。例如，利马豆和拟南芥会释放水杨酸甲酯，吸引大眼蝽、瓢虫（俗称花大姐）和草蛉等捕食性昆虫。这种策略不仅限于地上部分——根系同样能释放化学物质，将地下害虫的天敌吸引至土壤中。当西部玉米根虫威胁玉米植株时，玉米根部会释放化学信号，吸引以根虫为宿主的线虫前来捕食。</div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">25.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">When aphids attack, many plants emit a chemical called beta-farnesene. It does not appear to be a coincidence that when predators attack aphids, the aphids release this chemical, presumably warning other aphids to stay away. Thus, a plant releasing beta-farnesene is equivalent to a deer mimicking a lion roar when attacked by a leopard!
Plants, like animals, have found a way to their spectacular evolutionary success by focusing on reducing their errors of commission. In other words, like their animal counterparts, they avoid taking risks to their life and well-being at the cost of giving up some potentially juicy opportunities.
Buffett’s Two Rules of Investing
As one should expect, Warren Buffett figured out this lesson from evolutionary theory before almost everyone else. He famously coined his two rules of investing as follows:
Rule number 1: Never lose money.
Rule number 2: Never forget rule number 1.10</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">当蚜虫侵袭时，许多植物会释放一种名为β-法尼烯的化学物质。有趣的是，当捕食者攻击蚜虫时，蚜虫也会释放这种物质——很可能是为了警告同类远离危险。因此，植物释放β-法尼烯的行为，就像被豹子袭击的鹿模仿狮吼来吓退天敌！  

与动物界如出一辙，植物也通过最大限度减少"主动失误"实现了惊人的进化成功。换句话说，它们和动物一样，宁愿放弃某些潜在的高收益机会，也绝不拿生命安危冒险。  

巴菲特的投资两诫  
正如人们所料，沃伦·巴菲特比绝大多数人更早参透了这条进化论真谛。他 famously 将投资原则提炼为两句箴言：  
第一诫：永不亏本。  
第二诫：永记第一诫。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">26.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">But wait a minute. What does he mean by commanding us to “never lose money”? How can one choose not to lose money? Isn’t that what every investor wants? Why would any investor deliberately wish to lose money?
In fact, Buffett seems to have violated his own two rules on many occasions. For example, in 1993, Berkshire bought Dexter Shoe for $433 million in Berkshire stock. As he detailed in his 2007 annual letter, “What I had assessed as a durable competitive advantage vanished within a few years. . . . That move made the cost to Berkshire shareholders not $400 million, but rather $3.5 billion. In essence, I gave away 1.6 percent of a wonderful business—one now valued at $220 billion—to buy a worthless business.”</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">且慢。他所谓"永远不要亏钱"究竟何意？投资者怎么可能选择不亏损？这不正是每个投资者都期望的吗？谁会故意想要亏钱？

事实上，巴菲特本人似乎多次违背过这两条准则。例如1993年，伯克希尔用价值4.33亿美元的公司股票收购德克斯特鞋业。他在2007年致股东信中坦承："我原以为具有持久竞争优势的企业，短短几年内优势便荡然无存......这个错误让伯克希尔股东付出的代价不是4亿美元，而是35亿美元。实质上，我放弃了如今估值2200亿美元的优质企业1.6%的股权，换来的却是个毫无价值的公司。"</div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">27.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">In his 2014 annual letter, he admitted his mistake in Berkshire’s Tesco investment, “We sold Tesco shares throughout the year and now are out of this position. Our after-tax loss from this investment was $444 million. . . .” More recently, in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic market meltdown, Buffett sold all his airline stocks. He had invested between $7 billion and $8 billion for large stakes in four airlines: American, Delta, Southwest, and United. Berkshire’s position was worth a bit more than $4 billion at the time of his sale.11 “It turned out I was wrong,” he said.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">在2014年致股东信中，他承认了伯克希尔投资乐购的错误："我们全年都在抛售乐购股票，现已清仓。这笔投资的税后亏损达4.44亿美元......"而在近期新冠疫情引发的市场动荡中，巴菲特更是清仓了所有航空股。此前他斥资70至80亿美元重仓持有四家航空公司——美国航空、达美航空、西南航空和联合航空。伯克希尔持仓市值在其抛售时仅略超40亿美元。"事实证明我错了，"他坦言道。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">Back to Buffett’s two rules. Despite losing money occasionally, what is he asking us to do when he orders us not to lose any? Buffett has never explicitly explained this (at least I have never found an explanation), but this is what I think he means: Avoid big risks. Don’t make type I errors. Don’t commit to an investment in which the probability of losing money is higher than the probability of making money. Think about risk first, not return.
Before we go any further, allow me a slight digression to get the definition of “risk” out of the way. The definition I use in this book is not the same as the one defined by corporate finance theorists. Finance theory claims that risk is the chance that the actual investment return will differ from the expected investment return.12 Thus, if an asset is highly volatile, it will be classified as riskier than an asset that is not as volatile.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">回到巴菲特的投资两法则。尽管偶有亏损，当他告诫我们"永远不要亏钱"时，究竟在要求我们做什么？巴菲特从未明确解释过这一点（至少我从未找到相关说明），但我的理解是：规避重大风险。不要犯第一类错误。不要投入亏损概率高于盈利概率的投资。先考虑风险，再考虑收益。

在深入探讨之前，请容我稍作旁白厘清"风险"定义。本书采用的定义与企业金融理论家不同。金融理论认为风险是实际投资收益偏离预期收益的可能性。因此若资产价格波动剧烈，就会被归类为比波动平缓的资产更具风险。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">If you think about this for a moment, you will conclude that this is nonsensical. For any investor, risk should simply be the probability of incurring a capital loss. The following example will make this clear. Let’s say I am evaluating an investment in a high-quality grocery retailer. The retailer has been performing quite well, resulting in a steadily increasing stock price over the years. Let’s say the market price was $90 in early 2020. After the COVID-19 crisis, the stock market became highly volatile, and the market price of this business dropped to $30. Let’s also assume that you have done your work and have concluded that grocery retailers may benefit from the crisis since consumers will stock up their pantries. Which would be a riskier investment: investing in the business at $90 or at $30? If your intuition says $90, you are right. This is because the risk of losing money is greater at $90 than at $30. But, believe it or not, academics of finance would argue exactly the opposite! No, I am not kidding. They would conclude that the post-COVID-19 crisis business is riskier because the volatility of the stock price has increased!</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">稍加思考便会发现这种说法荒谬至极。对任何投资者而言，风险本质上就是本金损失的概率。举例说明更为直观：假设我正在评估一家优质杂货零售商的股票。该企业多年来业绩稳健，股价持续攀升，2020年初市价为90美元。新冠疫情爆发后股市剧烈震荡，该股价格跌至30美元。若通过分析得出杂货零售商可能因民众囤货而受益，那么请问：以90美元还是30美元买入风险更大？若直觉告诉你90美元，答案完全正确——因为此时亏损概率远高于30美元价位。但匪夷所思的是，金融学界竟持完全相反观点！绝非玩笑，他们会以股价波动加剧为由，断言疫情后的投资风险更高！</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">We at Nalanda never bring stock price volatility into a risk discussion. We define “risk” as the probability of capital loss. The higher the probability of loss, the higher the risk. If my investment in Company A is likely to lose more money over my investment in Company B, I will deem Company A to be “riskier” than Company B irrespective of past or future volatility in their stock prices.
As Buffett’s diktat shows, he is focused on minimizing risk and, in doing so, has become the envy of the entire investment world, which seems obsessed with running after every half-baked business idea. Buffett and the natural world are fixated on minimizing the risk of type I errors. Should we follow them blindly? Will the explicit lesson from Buffett and the implicit one from leopards and legumes work for ordinary mortals like us?
Why or why not?
A Great Investor Is a Great Rejector</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">在那烂陀，我们从不将股价波动纳入风险讨论范畴。我们将"风险"定义为资本损失的概率——损失概率越高，风险越大。若投资甲公司比投资乙公司更可能亏损，无论两者股价过往或未来如何波动，我都会判定甲公司"风险更高"。

正如巴菲特的投资铁律所示，他始终致力于风险最小化，正因如此，他成为了整个投资界艳羡的对象——而这个行业往往热衷于追逐每个半生不熟的商业概念。巴菲特与自然界都执着于避免第一类错误（误判风险）。我们是否该盲目效仿？巴菲特给出的显性经验与猎豹、豆科植物展现的隐性智慧，对我们这样的普通人真的适用吗？

            <div class="text-block original-text">Let’s walk through a simple example that contrasts two different investment styles. And let’s then see if Buffett’s advice makes sense. According to data from the World Bank, the United States had 4,400 listed companies in 2018.13 For simplicity, let’s assume a round 4,000. First, we need to decide how many of these are “good investments.” Let’s keep it simple and classify a “good investment” as one that will make us a decent return over the long run. It has a competent and honest management team, a modest growth rate, makes enough money, and has low leverage. If you are a finance nerd, you are probably bristling at this moment. What in the world do I mean by vague terms like “decent,” “enough,” and “competent”? Don’t worry, we will get into numbers shortly, but at this stage, let’s just say we know a good investment when we see it.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">让我们通过一个简单例子来对比两种不同的投资风格，然后验证巴菲特的建议是否合理。根据世界银行数据，2018年美国共有4400家上市公司。为简化计算，我们假设为4000家整。首先需要确定其中有多少属于"优质投资"。我们采用简单标准：能长期带来可观回报的企业即为优质投资，其标准包括诚实能干的管理团队、稳定的增长率、充足的盈利能力以及低负债率。此刻金融专业人士可能会对"可观"、"充足"、"能干"这些模糊表述提出质疑。别着急，稍后我们会具体量化这些指标，现阶段我们暂且采用"一眼可辨"的直观判断标准。</div>

In any event, the exact percentage is less significant, as we will see. Thus, we can say there are 1,000 good investments and 3,000 bad investments in the U.S. listed universe by this logic. Again, don’t get too pained about this strict dichotomy; it is serving a purpose that we will get to.</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">Let’s say you encounter a savvy investor who claims that he is right 80 percent of the time in his investment decisions (it is usually a “he”; we men are evolutionarily programmed for empty exaggerations). Stated differently, if he encounters a bad investment (i.e., one in which he will not make any money), he rejects it 80 percent of the time. If he sees a good investment (i.e., one in which he will make money), he makes a favorable investment decision 80 percent of the time. Thus, his rates of type I and type II errors are both 20 percent. If this star investor makes an investment decision, what is the probability that it is a good investment? You’d say 80 percent, right? Wrong. The answer is 57 percent. But why? Isn’t he right 80 percent of the time? How can we go from 80 percent to 57 percent?
Here is how.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">假设你遇到一位精明的投资者，他声称自己的投资决策有80%的正确率（通常用"他"——我们男性在进化中就被设定好了要夸大其词）。换句话说，当他遇到糟糕的投资（即无法盈利的项目）时，他有80%的概率会拒绝；而遇到优质投资（即能赚钱的项目）时，他有80%的概率会做出投资决定。也就是说，他的第一类错误和第二类错误概率均为20%。那么当这位明星投资者做出投资决定时，这个项目真正优质的概率是多少？你会说80%？错了。正确答案是57%。但为什么呢？他不是有80%的正确率吗？这个数字是怎么从80%降到57%的？

原因如下。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">34.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">There are 1,000 good investments in the market, and since this investor makes a type II error 20 percent of the time (i.e., he mistakenly rejects 20 percent of these), he will select only 800 companies from his list. The market also has 3,000 bad investments, and since he makes type I errors 20 percent of the time (i.e., he mistakenly accepts 20 percent of these), he will mistakenly select 600 companies from this list, thinking that they are good investments. Thus, his universe of what he thinks are good investments will be 1,400 companies (800 + 600). Are you with me? Good. Now to the most interesting part.
Of these 1,400 businesses that the investor thinks are good investments, how many do you think are good investments? Only 800. Hence, the probability of his making a good investment will be 800 ÷ 1,400 = 57 percent.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">市场上有1000个优质投资项目，由于这位投资者会犯20%的第二类错误（即错误拒绝其中20%的好项目），他最终只会从清单中选出800家公司。同时市场上还有3000个不良投资项目，由于他犯第一类错误的概率也是20%（即错误接受其中20%的坏项目），他会误将600家公司纳入选择范围，认为这些是优质投资。因此，他认定的"优质投资"总库将包含1400家公司（800+600）。跟得上思路吗？很好。现在来到最精彩的部分。

在这1400家被投资者认定为优质的企业中，你认为真正优质的有多少？只有800家。因此，他做出优质投资的概率将是800÷1400≈57%。</div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">35.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">So here is the unfortunate conclusion. Even if an investor is endowed with the divine power of being right 80 percent of the time, the probability that he will select a good investment is only 57 percent. Even though he is “right” 80 percent of the time, 43 percent of his investments will turn out to be bad! The reason is simple, especially when we incorporate our prior knowledge of the business world: There are very few good investments in the market.
Let me repeat this statement, which is the bedrock of our philosophy and that of the rest of this book: There are very few good investments in the market.
As we have just seen, the prevalence of type I and type II errors can lull us investors into thinking that we are better than we really are. But these errors carry a deeper meaning for our profession. Given a choice, which error would you like to reduce, and why?</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">不幸的结论由此浮现：即便某位投资者被赋予80%正确率的神谕，其选中优质投资的概率也仅有57%。尽管他拥有八成"正确率"，实际投资组合中仍将有43%沦为败笔！原因很简单——尤其当我们结合商业世界的基本现实时：市场中真正优质的投资标的寥寥无几。

请允许我重申这个构成我们投资哲学基石的核心观点，它也将贯穿全书：市场中真正优质的投资标的寥寥无几。

正如前文所示，第一类与第二类错误的普遍存在，往往诱使投资者高估自身判断力。但这两类错误对我们的职业具有更深刻的启示：若必须抉择，你会优先降低哪类错误？理由何在？</div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">36.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Let’s say that our investor, Investor A, decides to become better at rejecting bad investments and reduces his rate of type I errors from 20 percent to 10 percent. Thus, from the 3,000 bad investments in the market, he will select only 300 businesses (10 percent × 3,000). As his type II error rate remains 20 percent, he will erroneously reject 200 of the 1,000 good investments, thereby selecting 800 investments. Thus, Investor A has selected 1,100 investments (300 + 800), but only 800 of these are good. In this scenario, Investor A’s probability of selecting a good investment improves from 57 percent to 73 percent (800 ÷ 1,100). I assume you will admit that this is quite a dramatic improvement in his success rate.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">假设我们的投资者A决定提高甄别劣质投资的能力，将第一类错误率从20%降至10%。那么面对市场上3000个劣质项目，他只会选中300个（10%×3000）。由于他的第二类错误率仍保持20%，在1000个优质项目中会错误否决200个，最终选中800个。此时投资者A共选择1100个项目（300+800），其中优质项目占800个。这种情况下，他选中优质项目的概率从57%提升至73%（800÷1100），相信你会认同这是投资成功率的显著飞跃。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">37.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Investor B, unlike Investor A, is more focused on not missing out on good opportunities. He chooses to reduce his rate of type II errors from 20 percent to 10 percent and keeps his rate of type I errors at 20 percent. Thus, of the 1,000 good investments, he will select 900 (90 percent × 1,000), and of the 3,000 bad investments, he will mistakenly assume that 600 are good (20 percent × 3,000). Thus, Investor B has selected 1,500 investments (600 + 900), but only 900 are good. Thus, Investor B’s probability of selecting a good business improves from 57 percent to 60 percent (900 ÷ 1,500). This is an improvement—but only by 3 percentage points. Good, but not great.
The relative impact of reducing each type of error is quite stark, as shown in table 1.1.

            <div class="text-block simplified-text">投资者B与投资者A不同，他更关注不错失良机。他选择将第二类错误率从20%降至10%，同时将第一类错误率保持在20%。因此，在1000个优质投资项目中，他将选中900个（1000×90%）；而在3000个不良投资中，他会误判其中600个为优质项目（3000×20%）。这样投资者B共筛选出1500个投资项目（600+900），但其中仅有900个是真正优质的。其选中优质企业的概率从57%提升至60%（900÷1500）——虽然进步了3个百分点，但提升幅度有限。

表1.1数据显示，降低两类错误率带来的相对效益差异显著：
表1.1 第一类与第二类错误对比
第一类错误率 | 第二类错误率 | 成功率
20%         | 20%         | 57%
10%         | 20%         | 73%

            <span class="paragraph-number">38.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Thus, there is a 16-percentage-point improvement in investor performance by reducing the rate of type I errors from 20 percent to 10 percent. On the other hand, reducing the rate of type II errors by the same amount improves performance by only 3 percentage points.
Guess what happens if another investor, Investor C, improves his rate of both type I and type II errors from 20 percent to 10 percent. I was flabbergasted when I first saw the answer: 75 percent. This is barely above the 73 percent achieved by Investor A, who was focused only on reducing type I errors. A dramatic improvement in performance comes only when the rate of type I errors—errors of making bad investments—is reduced.
Thus, whereas most investment books and college curricula focus on teaching how to make good investments, everyone would be better off by learning how not to make bad investments. An investment career is probably among the very few that rewards the skeptic more than the optimist.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">因此，将第一类错误率从20%降至10%，投资者的表现可提升16个百分点。而同样幅度降低第二类错误率，表现仅提升3个百分点。试想若另一位投资者C将两类错误率同时从20%降至10%会如何？当我首次看到75%这个结果时震惊不已——这仅比专注降低第一类错误的投资者A的73%高出少许。唯有减少第一类错误（即避免糟糕投资），才能显著提升投资表现。

由此可见，尽管多数投资书籍和大学课程专注于教授如何选择优质投资，但学习规避不良投资才是更优策略。投资领域恐怕是极少数对怀疑者比对乐观者更慷慨的职业。</div>

How to Avoid Big Risks
It’s all well and good to assert that we should learn from the evolutionary success of animals and plants to avoid big risks and become better investors. But how?
There are myriad ways of learning life lessons—parents, siblings, one’s spouse, friends, books, movies, school, college, work, and leaders are a few sources that come to mind.

我们固然应当效仿动植物的进化智慧来规避重大风险、提升投资能力，但具体该如何实施？

            <div class="text-block original-text">Early in my investing career at Warburg Pincus, I committed the cardinal sin of minimizing errors of omission instead of trying to control type I errors. I was too afraid to miss out on good opportunities. I founded Nalanda after gaining more than eight years of investing experience. Our reasonable success of staying away from trouble is the result of the follies of the first three to four years of my career. In my case, nothing has succeeded like a failure.
Most investors will keep making type I errors (making bad investments) throughout their careers. At least I have, and I will. It’s inevitable. So when I say that we need to avoid type I errors, I am proposing that we try to avoid the avoidable type I error. By not taking on big risks. What is a big risk? It is not clear to me that a definition is possible or even desirable for a practitioner. Instead of defining “big risk,” let me describe the kinds of situations we avoid at Nalanda.</div>

绝大多数投资者终其职业生涯都难以摆脱第一类错误（投资失败项目），至少我过去如此，未来也难免。这无可避免。因此当我强调要规避第一类错误时，实则是建议我们应当竭力避开那些本可避免的误判——通过不承担重大风险的方式。何谓重大风险？作为实践者，我认为对此下定义既不可行也无必要。与其界定"重大风险"，不如谈谈那澜陀投资会规避哪些情境。</div>

As a result, we are highly vigilant and do not even start assessing the business fundamentals until we have convinced ourselves that the promoters have impeccable integrity. A KPMG report on the Indian private equity (PE) industry euphemistically claimed, “Many risks are common to all emerging markets—political and regulatory uncertainty and weak corporate governance among them. Many of these risks are more likely in India, even if they are not unique—such as working with family-owned businesses, navigating IPO exits and compliance risks.”14 This was a polite way of saying, “Beware of being swindled.”</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">We employ a two-level process for this assessment. We always hire a forensic diligence expert to assess if the owner or senior managers have a dubious past. During this period, we conduct our parallel diligence on the promoters and managers by scouring the media, studying past annual reports, listening to their conference call recordings, reading their interviews, and talking to people who have had personal and business dealings with them. In almost half the cases, we ask the external firm to further probe issues that have arisen during our diligence (for example, money leakage for large capex contracts or a cash payment to senior managers). This dual check provided by outsourcing and insourcing has prevented a lot of heartburn for us over the years. More importantly, it has saved a lot of money for our investors.
But shouldn’t this be obvious?</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">我们采用双重流程进行评估。首先必定聘请法务尽调专家核查企业主或高管是否存在不良记录；与此同时，我们通过检索媒体报道、研读历年财报、收听业绩电话会、分析访谈内容、走访相关人士等方式，对实际控制人和管理层开展平行调查。近半数案例中，我们会要求外部机构针对尽调发现的问题进行深度核查（例如大额资本支出合同资金流失或向高管支付现金等情况）。这种内外结合的双重校验机制多年来让我们规避了许多隐患，更重要的是为投资者避免了巨额损失。

Governance checks in India should be par for the course. But they are not. Let’s take an example of investing in the infrastructure and real estate sectors. In India, these two industries are highly regulated, involve a lot of cash transactions, and require a plethora of approvals; hence, over the years, they have attracted a set of entrepreneurs who can successfully “manage” the system. Looking for the proverbial needle in a haystack would be a cakewalk compared to finding infrastructure and real estate entrepreneurs who don’t mistreat minority shareholders. We have chosen to avoid these industries completely.</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">When we launched Nalanda in 2007, it was a boom time for fundraising in the real estate and infrastructure sectors. According to a McKinsey report, from 2005 to 2008, real estate absorbed almost a quarter of all PE investments, and infrastructure’s share was nearly 30 percent.15 A relatively large portion of these ended up in a disaster, and PE and public market investors lost billions of dollars. Real estate returns on exit were only 2 percent, and only 9 percent of energy segment investments could get an exit. One key reason for this unfortunate outcome was the adverse selection of entrepreneurs by the fund management community.
But it would be hypocritical of me to complain about others when I, too, have fallen into the same trap.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">2007年我们创立那烂陀时，正值房地产和基础设施领域募资的黄金时期。麦肯锡报告显示，2005至2008年间，房地产吸收了近四分之一的私募股权投资，基础设施占比则接近30%。这些投资中有相当比例最终惨败收场，私募与公开市场投资者损失了数十亿美元。房地产投资的退出回报率仅为2%，能源领域投资仅有9%能成功退出。造成这一不幸结局的关键原因，在于基金管理行业对创业者的逆向选择。

            <div class="text-block original-text">Let’s go back to the business for which I led the investment of $50 million from Warburg Pincus and which seemed to have ticked all the boxes. Here is what I did not tell you on the first page of this chapter: The governance check from the outsourced firm had given a clean chit to the promoter, but our internal team had heard some informal negative “buzz” about him. It wasn’t strong or unequivocal, but it was buzz nevertheless. I ignored it. I am still not sure why. Maybe I trusted our outsourced provider more than I should have, maybe I had become arrogant owing to recent successes, maybe I had been too charmed by the smooth-talking promoter, maybe I was in too deep after completing many months of diligence, or maybe all of the above.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">让我们回到那笔由我主导、华平投资注资5000万美元的交易，这项目看似完美无缺。但本章开篇时我未提及的是：外包公司的合规审查虽为该创始人出具了无保留意见，但我们内部团队却听到关于他的非正式负面传闻。这些传言既不明确也不强烈，但确实存在。我选择了忽视——至今仍不确定原因。或许我过度信任了外包服务商，或许因近期成功而变得自负，或许被那位能言善道的创始人迷惑，又或许因历时数月的尽调已投入太多沉没成本，更可能是以上所有因素的综合作用。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">At this stage, I should have gone back to our service provider and asked them to do more work. I also should have dug deeper into the veracity of the criticisms of the promoter. I didn’t do either of these things. It was too late by the time we discovered this individual’s shenanigans; he had sucked the company dry, and Warburg lost almost all its money. Since this incident, I have been extra cautious, both at Warburg and at Nalanda. We never invest unless we are fully and absolutely satisfied with the governance standards. We haven’t lost a single dollar at Nalanda yet on dodgy promoters, but this doesn’t mean we never will. But if we ever do, it will not be because we didn’t do our best.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">在这个阶段，我本应回头去找我们的服务提供商，要求他们做更多工作。我也本应更深入地调查那位发起人批评言论的真实性。这两件事我都没做。当我们发现此人的诡计时已为时太晚——他榨干了公司资金，华宝几乎损失了全部投资。自那以后，无论是在华宝还是在Nalanda，我都格外谨慎。除非对企业的治理标准完全满意，否则我们绝不投资。迄今为止，Nalanda尚未因可疑的发起人损失过一分钱，但这并不意味着永远不会发生。但即便真的发生，也绝不会是因为我们未尽全力。</div>

The fact remains that there are some well-known dodgy businesses in India whose stock prices have done reasonably well over the past few years. But we have never played this game and never will. Our philosophy of permanent ownership requires—demands—that we partner only with promoters of the highest integrity. And so that is what we do.

In the early 1990s, about half its revenues came from huge mainframe computers sold to businesses. These mainframes had hardware and software bundled into one system. The world, however, was fast shifting to smaller and midsized machines running on microprocessors. The technology universe was witnessing the unbundling of hardware and software with different vendors specializing in each segment. Companies like HP, Sun, Compaq, and Dell were eating IBM’s lunch on hardware, and Microsoft and Oracle were starting to dominate software.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">首当其冲的是IBM公司，这家企业在20世纪下半叶曾是科技界的霸主。90年代初期，其近半数营收来自面向企业销售的大型主机系统——这类设备将硬件与软件捆绑为一体。然而技术领域正迅速转向基于微处理器的中小型机器，硬件与软件开始解绑，不同厂商专攻各自细分市场。惠普、太阳微系统、康柏和戴尔等公司在硬件领域蚕食IBM的份额，微软和甲骨文则开始主导软件行业。90年代末，来自RJR纳贝斯克的前任CEO郭士纳领导了IBM著名的转型。该公司原名国际商业机器公司（International Business Machines），曾是科技界的庞然大物。</div>

The market was betting that Johnson would be the miracle cure for JCPenney. He changed everything at the company—the logo, the store design, the advertisements, the pricing model, and the popular private labels. JCPenney was known for coupons and clearance sales—Johnson ended them. Big mistake. In 2012, sales dropped 25 percent, from $17 billion to $13 billion, as customers abandoned the stores en masse. More worryingly, the company suffered an operating loss of $1.3 billion. The board fired Johnson in mid-2013, just seventeen months after installing him as CEO.

She is hyper-focused on just one aspect of P&L: EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization). P&L obsession is not limited to consultants.

Receivables, inventory, payables, fixed assets. And most important of all, debt. Corporate finance theory has a thing for leverage. For those of you who are not familiar with it, finance academics claim that companies need to have an “optimal” level of leverage to improve returns.18 If a company can borrow money to purchase assets, its return on equity and earnings per share should improve. Mathematically, this is undoubtedly true. Realistically, this is undoubtedly dangerous.
What could be more important than improving short-term return on equity and earnings per share for a business? In my view, two things.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">经过多年投资后，我意识到自己需要同样重视——甚至更重视——公司的资产负债表。应收账款、存货、应付账款、固定资产。而最重要的是债务。公司金融理论对杠杆情有独钟。金融学者主张企业需要维持"最优"杠杆水平来提升回报率。从数学角度看这无疑成立，但从现实角度看这无疑充满危险。

对企业而言，有什么比提升短期股本回报率和每股收益更重要？我认为有两件事。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">Start with the easy one. Survival. There is no point in improving return on equity by a few percentage points if it compromises long-term survival. The COVID-19 crisis demonstrated clearly that the companies caught with their pants down were the ones with substantial leverage. In the second quarter of 2020, the following are just some of the well-known companies that announced bankruptcy: Gold’s Gym, Hertz, Intelsat, J. Crew, JCPenney, Neiman Marcus, and Sur La Table.19 Here is what is common across all these names: All had a large amount of debt. It is not impossible for an unleveraged business to go belly up, but it sure is quite hard. If I were to list the twenty biggest bankruptcies in the United States,20 you would notice that all—with Lehman at the top and LyondellBasell at number 20—were heavily indebted.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">从最简单的生存问题说起。若要以牺牲长期生存为代价换取几个百分点的股本回报率提升，这样的改进毫无意义。新冠疫情危机清楚地表明，那些措手不及的企业往往背负着巨额债务。2020年第二季度，以下知名企业相继宣布破产：金吉姆健身、赫兹租车、国际通信卫星、J.Crew服饰、杰西潘尼百货、尼曼玛库斯百货以及Sur La Table厨具。这些企业的共同点是：均负债累累。无负债企业虽非绝对不可能倒闭，但确实极为罕见。若列举美国二十大规模破产案例，从榜首雷曼兄弟到第二十位的利安德巴塞尔，无一不是债台高筑。</div>

One might also contend that mismanagement or other factors contributed more to their downfall than debt. And that “correlation is not causation.” Maybe. But it’s one hell of a correlation. As a long-term investor in a business, I don’t want the company ever to go bankrupt—whether the times are good or bad. I can live with a slightly lower return on equity and lower earnings-per-share (EPS) growth, but at least I will live.
Not having high leverage probably makes sense to everyone. But the following may not: I am an advocate of no leverage. More than 90 percent of our portfolio companies have—and have always had—excess cash. Only three businesses out of about thirty in our portfolio have some debt. But even this debt is quite small—the maximum debt/equity ratio among these three is 0.3.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">或许有人会说这些企业只是时运不济，倘若没有新冠疫情一切都会安然无恙。也可能有人辩称管理不善或其他因素比债务问题更具破坏性，并强调"相关性不等于因果性"。或许如此。但这种相关性实在触目惊心。作为企业的长期投资者，我不希望公司以任何形式破产——无论经济景气与否。我宁可接受略低的股本回报率和每股收益增长率，至少这样能确保生存。

零杠杆原则或许人人都能理解，但接下来的主张未必如此：我主张彻底零杠杆。我们投资组合中90%以上的企业始终持有超额现金。约三十家被投企业中，仅三家存在少量债务——即便是这三家，其负债权益比最高也仅为0.3。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">Why would I demand zero debt when a modest level would not compromise the survival of the business? The answer lies in the following Business Insider headline: “No Layoff, Asian Paints Will Give Salary Increments to Boost Employees Morale.”21
Asian Paints is India’s largest paints business and probably one of the country’s best-run businesses. As an aside, it is sadly not in our portfolio. I had a chance to buy it during the global financial crisis of 2008, but I refused to pay 15 percent more for the privilege of owning this marvelous compounder. I was a fool. Anyway, let’s return to a more pleasant topic.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">既然适度负债不会危及企业生存，为何我还要坚持零负债？答案藏在《商业内幕》这则标题中："亚洲涂料宣布不裁员并加薪以提振员工士气"。  

亚洲涂料是印度最大的涂料企业，或许也是该国经营最出色的公司之一。遗憾的是，它并不在我们的投资组合中。2008年全球金融危机期间，我曾有机会收购这家卓越的复利增长型企业，却因不愿多付15%的溢价而错失良机。我真是个傻瓜。不过，还是让我们回到更愉快的话题上来。

            <div class="text-block original-text">This “no-layoff, salary increment” story would not be newsworthy in normal times. But this announcement was made on May 15, 2020. At the time, India had been under an almost complete lockdown since mid-March as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Every business was witnessing a catastrophic decline in revenues and profits. Also, no one had any visibility as to when the situation would improve—remember that the possibility of vaccines wasn’t even on the horizon in May 2020. Asian Paints was itself going through a catastrophic quarter—during the period from April to June 2020, the company’s revenue declined by 43 percent, and its net profit went down by 67 percent compared to the same period in 2019. Was the company foolish to be increasing salaries in this period? No. Just cash rich. In March 2020, at the start of the pandemic, the company had $220 million cash (its revenue for the year ended March 2020 was $2.9 billion).</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">这段"不裁员还加薪"的新闻若在平日根本不算事。但这份公告发布于2020年5月15日——当时印度因新冠疫情已实施近乎全面封锁近两个月。所有企业都面临收入与利润的断崖式下跌，且无人能预见形势何时好转（须知2020年5月时疫苗问世还遥遥无期）。亚洲涂料公司自身也正经历灾难性季度：2020年4至6月期间，其营收同比下滑43%，净利润较2019年同期暴跌67%。此时加薪是否愚蠢？非也。不过是家底厚实——2020年3月疫情爆发时，该公司持有2.2亿美元现金（其截至2020年3月的财年营收为29亿美元）。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">Which brings me to the second reason I detest any debt. This answer is often underappreciated and even ignored by investors and management. It is this: Debt diminishes strategic flexibility and hence long-term value creation. For a day trader or even an investor whose holding period ranges from three to five years, a reasonable amount of leverage may not matter. But for a permanent owner like Nalanda, any constraint that prevents a business from taking calculated strategic bets is undesirable.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">这让我想到厌恶债务的第二个原因——这个答案常被投资者和管理层低估甚至忽视：债务会削弱战略灵活性，从而损害长期价值创造。对于日内交易者乃至持有周期三到五年的投资者而言，适度杠杆或许无关紧要。但对像那烂陀这样追求永久持有的所有者而言，任何阻碍企业进行审慎战略押注的束缚都不可取。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">Asian Paints is the leader in the highly competitive Indian paints industry; its competitors can and do copy what the business is trying to do. However, every few years, the company gets an opportunity to make an investment or take a strategic bet that its competitors find hard to emulate. The salary increase was one such bet. But it did not stop there. The company sanitized its dealers’ paint shops without charging any fees, offered medical insurance to its painters, gave forty-five-day extensions on payments to its dealers, and announced relief worth more than $5 million to its contractors. The CEO, Amit Syngle, pointed out, “We have been debt free for years and are quite comfortably placed even if the uncertainty goes on for the next four or five months.”22</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">亚洲涂料公司在竞争激烈的印度涂料行业中处于领先地位；其竞争对手能够且确实会效仿该公司的经营策略。然而每隔几年，这家企业就会获得进行投资或战略押注的机会，而这些举措往往令竞争者难以复制。全员加薪正是这样一次战略决策。但他们的举措远不止于此：公司为经销商涂料门店提供免费消杀服务，为涂装工人购买医疗保险，给予经销商45天账期延长，并向承包商提供价值逾500万美元的纾困方案。首席执行官阿米特·辛格勒指出："我们已连续多年保持零负债，即便不确定性持续四到五个月，公司财务状况依然相当稳健。"</div>

            <div class="text-block simplified-text">这家公司的慷慨之举或许短期内难以显现成效，但其长远影响必将深远。亚洲涂料之所以能采取这些极不寻常的举措，除了得益于非凡的战略眼光外，更因其零负债的财务根基。</div>

But this premise is false. Bad things happen to businesses at remarkably regular intervals. The harsh reality of companies in any capitalist society—and the reason to always have cash—is not that things can go wrong, but that they do go wrong. Businesses suffer adversity across a wide range of situations: The macroeconomic environment can become a stiff headwind as in the global financial crisis of 2008 or a recession; the industry can suffer a cyclical downturn; a well-funded competitor can start overspending on advertising or giving discounts; the company can lose some of its best employees to competitors; one or more major customers can leave or go belly up; consumer tastes can suddenly change; a large strategic acquisition or investment may not pay off; a factory can catch fire or a supplier may get in trouble; currency can move adversely in a foreign market that contributes to significant sales; regulations can get in the way; the company can get sued for a significant amount.

            <div class="text-block original-text">None of these issues is hypothetical—I have seen all of these happen to our portfolio companies over more than two decades of investing. Occasionally, two or more problems can arise simultaneously, putting significant pressure on businesses. While worrying about market share loss, low supplier commitment, competitor aggression, and employee dissatisfaction, the last thing management should worry about is interest payments. In my experience, only when the financial risk is low can management focus on mitigating business risks.
I have always maintained that the notion of an “optimal” capital structure that requires companies to have leverage, which is espoused by corporate finance theorists, is not just wrong but dangerous. A strong balance sheet is not the one that maximizes debt to minimize the cost of capital but the one that minimizes debt to maximize the safety of capital.
Fortunately, none of the owners of Nalanda portfolio companies studied finance at fancy business schools.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">这些问题无一例外都是真实存在的——在二十多年的投资生涯中，我亲眼目睹它们在我们的被投企业身上轮番上演。有时两三个问题会同时爆发，给企业带来巨大压力。当管理层疲于应对市场份额流失、供应商忠诚度下降、竞争对手猛烈进攻和员工士气低落时，最不该让他们分心的就是利息偿付问题。根据我的经验，只有当财务风险足够低时，管理层才能集中精力化解经营风险。

我始终认为，公司金融理论家鼓吹的"最优"资本结构论——即企业必须运用杠杆——不仅是错误的，更是危险的。强大的资产负债表不在于通过最大化债务来最小化资本成本，而在于通过最小化债务来最大化资本安全。

Nothing happens in well-oiled businesses on a day-to-day basis. Sorry, a lot happens, but it’s largely mundane, repetitive, uninteresting, dull, and monotonous. And this is the way it should be.

Here is a typical day or week or month or year: The factory manufactures bars of soap in the thousands and performs quality control checks to reject defects; the packing department stacks the bars in boxes; logistics ensures timely shipping at pre-agreed costs; warehouses stock the boxes in assigned positions; last-mile delivery delivers the bars on time; and the finance department records the payments received from the retailers.

The investment bankers and financiers who make fat fees love them even more. Following such an announcement, the CEO is typically invited to a CNBC interview during which they will extol the virtues of “strategic fit,” “synergies,” “culture fit,” and other boilerplate platitudes uttered in every single M&A.

The largest failed merger in the history of the corporate world.23 Within two years, AOL took a write-off of $99 billion on the deal.

            <div class="text-block original-text">But they don’t point out the single biggest reason we detest M&A: opportunity cost. Let’s visit the German giant Bayer to understand this reason.
Dr. Marijn Dekkers, the chair of Bayer AG, had every reason to be proud in 2015. During his five years as chair, this life sciences company has grown revenue from €35 billion to €46 billion, and its EPS had more than tripled from €1.6 per share to €5 per share. It continued its reign as the largest company on the German stock exchange with a market value of about €140 billion. The 2015 annual report was replete with good news. Without being boastful, Dr. Dekker’s excellent commentary made it evident that the company was one of the world’s leading life sciences businesses.
The only piece of bad news was tucked away on page seven of the report. Dr. Dekkers wrote, “This is my last Chairman’s Letter to you as CEO of Bayer.”</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">但他们没有指出我们厌恶并购的最大原因：机会成本。让我们以德国巨头拜耳为例来理解这一原因。2015年，拜耳集团董事长马林·德克斯博士完全有理由感到自豪。在他担任董事长的五年间，这家生命科学公司的营收从350亿欧元增长至460亿欧元，每股收益更是从1.6欧元飙升至5欧元，增长逾两倍。拜耳以约1400亿欧元的市值稳居德国证券交易所最大上市公司宝座。2015年年报满载喜讯，德克斯博士的精彩评述虽未自夸，却清晰表明该公司已是全球生命科学领域的领军企业。

In 2020, its sales had fallen to €41 billion from €46 billion in 2015; from being a highly profitable business with a return on equity of 18 percent in 2015, it declared a net loss of €10 billion; and its dividend per share was 20 percent lower than in 2015. Oh, and by June 2021, less than six years after the glorious year of 2015, Bayer’s market value had declined by 65 percent to €50 billion.
What happened? Within ten days of Dr. Dekker’s departure, Bayer made a bid to acquire Monsanto, the U.S. agrochemical giant. Bayer ended up paying $63 billion for the acquisition, which was more than Bayer’s market value in June 2021!</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">德克尔博士的爆料对拜耳造成了多严重的打击？2020年，该公司销售额从2015年的460亿欧元骤降至410亿欧元；这个2015年净资产收益率高达18%的盈利巨头，竟宣告净亏损100亿欧元；每股分红较2015年缩水20%。更糟的是，截至2021年6月——距离辉煌的2015年还不到六年——拜耳市值已暴跌65%，仅剩500亿欧元。

究竟发生了什么？德克尔博士离职十日内，拜耳竟发起对美国农化巨头孟山都的收购。最终以630亿美元成交价完成并购，这一数字甚至超过了2021年6月拜耳自身的总市值！</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">If you read reports on the reasons for this disaster, most will focus on Bayer losing multiple lawsuits and incurring billions in damages because plaintiffs were able to convince the U.S. courts that Monsanto’s Roundup weed killer causes cancer. The reports aren’t wrong, but they missed the real value destroyer invisible in the Bayer–Monsanto transaction, and the reason we abhor almost all M&A: opportunity cost. Stated simply, most analyses of M&A failure focus on the bad things that happened, rather than on the good things that didn’t happen.
Let’s see what Bayer may have missed doing by making a gargantuan acquisition. These actions (and inactions) fall into three categories: divestiture of attractive businesses, reduced focus on existing businesses, and missed opportunities.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">若查阅有关这场灾难成因的报道，多数会聚焦于拜耳输掉多起诉讼并承担数十亿美元赔偿——因为原告成功使美国法院相信孟山都的农达除草剂致癌。这些报道并非错误，但它们忽略了拜耳-孟山都交易中隐形的真正价值破坏者，也是我们厌恶几乎所有并购案的根本原因：机会成本。简言之，多数并购失败分析只关注已发生的坏事，而非未发生的好事。

让我们看看拜耳因这场巨额收购可能错失的机遇。这些行动（与不作为）可分为三类：剥离优质业务、弱化现有业务专注度，以及错失发展良机。</div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">80.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">After acquiring Monsanto, Bayer had to divest many of its core businesses for two reasons. First, regulators forced them to do so because both companies were large players in the agrochemical sector. Second, Bayer had to pay down the huge debt they had incurred to finance the deal. Bayer’s net debt had gone up ten times from €3.6 billion in 2017 to €36 billion in 2018!</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">收购孟山都后，拜耳被迫剥离多项核心业务，原因有二。首先，因两家公司在农化领域均占据重要地位，监管机构强制要求其拆分业务。其次，拜耳需偿还为完成收购累积的巨额债务——其净负债额从2017年的36亿欧元飙升至2018年的360亿欧元，激增十倍！</div>
        </div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">81.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">In 2017, Bayer divested large parts of its seed and herbicide businesses for €6 billion. In 2018, it sold its 60 percent stake in a highly lucrative business called Currenta for €1 billion and sold the consumer brands Coppertone and Dr. Scholl’s. In 2020, Bayer exited its leading and highly profitable Animal Health business for €7 billion. If we add up the sale value of these divestitures, that’s at least €15 billion, or about 30 percent of Bayer’s market value in mid-2021. These businesses had been owned and run by Bayer for decades, and so it is possible that the market was assigning a much higher value than €15 billion to them when they were inside Bayer. The future benefit from these attractive businesses was lost forever. The geese laying golden eggs were slaughtered to buy a hen that refused to lay any eggs.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">2017年，拜耳以60亿欧元出售了旗下大部分种子和除草剂业务。2018年，该公司以10亿欧元出让了高利润企业Currenta的60%股份，并剥离了防晒品牌Coppertone与足部护理品牌Dr. Scholl's。2020年，拜耳又以70亿欧元退出其处于市场领先地位且利润丰厚的动物保健业务。这些剥离项目的总售价至少达150亿欧元，约占拜耳2021年年中市值的30%。这些业务由拜耳持有并运营数十年，因此当其仍隶属于拜耳时，市场给予它们的估值很可能远高于150亿欧元。这些优质业务带来的未来收益已永久丧失——为购买一只拒绝下蛋的母鸡，人们宰杀了会下金蛋的鹅。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">The second major opportunity cost is a reduced focus on existing businesses because of the distraction of a bad acquisition. You can see this in Bayer’s annual reports of 2018, 2019, and 2020, in which a lot of ink was expended on justifying the acquisition and on steps being taken to mitigate the disaster. As usual, numbers tell a better story, as I will explain next.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">第二大机会成本是：由于糟糕收购案带来的干扰，企业会减少对现有业务的关注。这一点在拜耳2018、2019和2020年的年报中体现得淋漓尽致——大量篇幅被用于为收购辩护，以及阐述为缓解灾难所采取的措施。但正如常理所示，数字更能说明问题，接下来我将详述这一点。</div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">83.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Bayer has three business divisions: pharmaceuticals, consumer health, and crop science. From 2016 to 2020, the sales of its pharma division stayed flat at around €16 billion to €17 billion. (Although 2020 was the year of COVID, most global pharma companies did not experience a decline in sales.) Could this stagnation have been due to the acquisition distraction? From 2010 to 2015, pharma sales had more than doubled from €6.6 billion to €13.7 billion. From 2015 to 2020, rather than assuming a doubling of sales, let’s consider a modest 50 percent increase in a scenario in which management was not being compelled to fight fires. This would have led to pharma sales of €21 billion. The actual number was €17 billion. I think it’s fair to assume that Bayer’s pharma division “lost” sales of €4 billion as a result of the Monsanto acquisition. The market value of global pharma companies is about three to five times sales. Let’s be conservative and take a 2.5-times multiple. This is an opportunity cost of at least €10 billion.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">拜耳集团下设三大业务部门：制药、消费者健康与作物科学。2016至2020年间，其制药部门销售额始终在160亿至170亿欧元间徘徊（尽管2020年爆发了新冠疫情，但全球大多数制药企业并未出现销售额下滑）。这种停滞是否源于收购案带来的精力分散？2010至2015年期间，该部门销售额从66亿欧元激增至137亿欧元，实现翻倍增长。假设管理层无需应对危机，2015至2020年间即便仅实现50%的温和增长，制药销售额也应达到210亿欧元，而实际数字仅为170亿欧元。可以合理推断，收购孟山都导致拜耳制药部门损失了约40亿欧元销售额。全球制药企业的市值通常为销售额的3至5倍，即便保守采用2.5倍乘数计算，其机会成本也至少达100亿欧元。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">84.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">The operating income of Bayer’s consumer health division declined from €1.2 billion in 2015 to €0.8 billion in 2019 (let’s ignore 2020, when many consumer businesses were affected by COVID). Most global consumer businesses grew their operating income during this period. Similarly, the operating income of Bayer’s crop science division fell from €2.1 billion to €1.9 billion during this period while its competitors did much better. And remember that Monsanto’s acquisition is counted in the crop science division, and so despite the $63 billion acquisition, the operating income of the division fell from 2015 to 2019!</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">拜耳消费者健康部门的营业收入从2015年的12亿欧元降至2019年的8亿欧元（2020年因新冠疫情冲击众多消费品企业，暂不纳入统计）。同期多数全球消费品企业均实现营业收入增长。同样，拜耳作物科学部门营业收入在此期间从21亿欧元下滑至19亿欧元，而其竞争对手表现远优于该部门。需特别注意的是，收购孟山都的交易已计入作物科学部门——尽管这笔收购耗资630亿美元，该部门2015至2019年的营业收入仍呈现下滑态势！</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">85.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">In 2015, the operating income of the consumer health and crop science divisions added up to a little more than half the consolidated operating income of Bayer. Thus, we can conservatively assume that at least a third of Bayer’s value in 2015 was derived from these two divisions. Since Bayer’s value was €140 billion in 2015, we can assign a value of at least €45 billion to €50 billion to these divisions for 2015 (which was the total value of Bayer in June 2021). What was the opportunity cost of the underperformance of these two divisions? If the top management had not been consumed by Monsanto’s unending troubles, and if they had enhanced their 2015 value by 30 to 50 percent over the next five years, we see a likely missed gain of around €15 billion to €25 billion.
Let’s now come to the third, and probably the largest, opportunity cost: missed opportunities. For Bayer, this was not making a COVID-19 vaccine.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">2015年，拜耳消费者健康与作物科学两大事业部的运营收入合计略超集团合并运营收入的半数。因此我们可以保守估算，2015年拜耳企业价值中至少有三分之一源自这两个部门。鉴于拜耳2015年总估值为1400亿欧元，这两个事业部当年估值至少应达450亿至500亿欧元（该数值相当于2021年6月拜耳整体市值）。那么这两个部门业绩不佳的机会成本是多少？若最高管理层未被孟山都的持续危机所困，而是能在随后五年间将其2015年估值提升30%至50%，我们测算其潜在收益损失约在150亿至250亿欧元之间。

现在来看第三项——很可能也是最大的一项——机会成本：错失的机遇。对拜耳而言，这个机遇就是未能研发新冠疫苗。</div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">86.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Imagine the end of 2019 at Bayer. The company’s leverage has multiplied more than nine times since 2017 to €34 billion, the U.S. litigation is getting uglier and more costly by the month, the return on capital is down to less than 4 percent from the high teens a few years earlier, and the investors are as angry as hell with the stock price falling to half its peak, also a few years earlier.
And then COVID strikes in early 2020. Do you think the senior management assembled around the table at corporate headquarters and said, “Let’s bet billions on developing a vaccine that we do not even know is possible”? Would the Bayer management have been willing to take a bet on an uncertain outcome given their dire operating and financial condition? We will never know for sure, and your guess is as good as mine, but a shot in the dark for an uncertain payoff by this long-suffering company? Unlikely.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">试想2019年末的拜耳集团：公司负债自2017年起激增九倍至340亿欧元，美国诉讼案每月愈演愈烈且成本攀升，资本回报率从几年前近20%的高位暴跌至不足4%，股价较数年前峰值腰斩令投资者怒火中烧。

2020年初新冠疫情爆发时，你能想象这家企业的高管们围坐在总部会议室说"让我们押注数十亿开发一款甚至不确定能否成功的疫苗"吗？以拜耳当时严峻的经营和财务状况，管理层真会豪赌这种不确定的结果吗？我们永远无法确知答案——你的猜测与我同样有效——但这家饱经风霜的企业会为渺茫的回报孤注一掷吗？恐怕不会。</div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">87.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Bayer’s 2020 annual report mentions that they signed an agreement with a biotech company to develop and manufacture a COVID-19 vaccine that would be launched in 2022. Meanwhile, four competitors of Bayer—AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, and Pfizer—had administered about five billion doses by July 2021.
The COVID-19 vaccine contributes to almost all of Moderna’s revenues and profits, and so Moderna is a good candidate to use to assess the notional loss for Bayer. From December 2019 (before the pandemic hit) until July 2021, Moderna added about $120 billion (€100 billion) to its market value. If we assume that the probability of Bayer’s success would have been 50 to 75 percent (after all, it was one of the global leaders), Bayer has foregone €50 billion to €75 billion in value creation owing to its inability (or was it its unwillingness?) to develop a vaccine.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">拜耳集团2020年度报告提及，其已与某生物科技公司签署协议，共同研发生产一款计划于2022年上市的新冠疫苗。然而截至2021年7月，拜耳的四家竞争对手——阿斯利康、强生、莫德纳和辉瑞——已累计接种约50亿剂疫苗。

莫德纳的营收与利润几乎全部来源于新冠疫苗业务，因此该企业可作为评估拜耳潜在损失的理想参照样本。2019年12月（疫情暴发前）至2021年7月期间，莫德纳市值增长约1200亿美元（折合1000亿欧元）。若假设拜耳成功研发疫苗的概率为50%至75%（毕竟其曾是全球行业领军者之一），那么由于开发疫苗的能力缺失（抑或是意愿不足？），拜耳错失了500亿至750亿欧元的市值增长空间。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">88.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">If we add up all these numbers, the opportunity cost of Monsanto’s acquisition is probably in the range of €90 billion to €100 billion. In other words, instead of about €50 billion in June 2021, Bayer could have been valued at €140 billion to €150 billion. How do we know this is not a massive overstatement? Because Bayer’s value in 2015 was €140 billion. If anything, this opportunity cost calculation is a significant understatement because it assumes almost no additional value creation since 2015, while every other major pharmaceutical, consumer, and agrochemical business has added significant value since 2015.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">若将所有这些数字相加，孟山都收购案的机遇成本很可能在900亿至1000亿欧元之间。换言之，拜耳集团在2021年6月的估值本可达到1400亿至1500亿欧元，而非实际约500亿欧元。为何能断定这一估算没有严重夸大？因为拜耳2015年的市值已达1400亿欧元。事实上，这个机遇成本计算仍属显著低估——其假设前提是2015年以来几乎没有创造额外价值，而同期其他所有大型制药、消费品及农化企业的价值均实现了大幅增长。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">I don’t know anything about Bayer’s management, but presumably they are world class given their outsized success before 2016. If that’s the case, how did they get lulled into making such an acquisition? Because like most acquirers across the world, they genuinely believed that this time, it’s different. Managers—especially high-performing ones—and their advisers have a sense of invincibility and arrogance when evaluating a target. They firmly believe that they will buck the trend the corporate world has witnessed for a century. Most of them don’t realize their folly until it’s too late.
If a business is a serial acquirer, we stay away. We know we can’t price the risk. If we had been evaluating Bayer as a new investment in 2016, we would have passed until we were convinced that management would not repeat its mistakes.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">我对拜耳的管理层一无所知，但鉴于他们在2016年前的卓越成就，想必是世界一流的。既然如此，他们为何会昏了头做出这样的收购？因为和全球大多数收购方一样，他们真心相信这次会不一样。管理者——尤其是业绩优异者——及其顾问在评估标的时，总带着战无不胜的傲慢。他们坚信自己能逆袭企业界百年来的并购趋势。等大多数人醒悟时，往往为时已晚。

若某企业是连环收购者，我们就会避而远之。因为我们无法为这种风险定价。假设2016年评估拜耳作为新投资标的时，我们会选择放弃，直到确信管理层不会再犯同样的错误。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">Some of our portfolio companies do occasionally make acquisitions. Our counsel to them is to be deeply skeptical of the potential value creation in all cases. I will admit that the success rate of our advice has not been very high. Fortunately, none of our companies is addicted to M&A, and the ones that do make acquisitions have never bet the company. I am convinced that the cost of distraction—even if it was a small one—has not been worth the effort. If any of them start becoming serial acquirers, we will promptly press the exit button.

            <div class="text-block original-text">Railways transformed the United Kingdom in the early nineteenth century.25 The first passenger railway between Liverpool and Manchester was authorized by Parliament in 1826 and opened in 1830. Railways allowed people to travel farther at a much lower cost and in less time than the alternatives. They also spurred the growth of cities by enabling cheaper and faster transport of people and building materials. Many entrepreneurs jumped into the fray and by 1844 had opened more than 2,200 miles of railroad line. The stock market loved these companies, which promised growth forever. Between 1843 and 1850, 442 railway companies made a public offering of shares. Between January 1, 1843, and August 9, 1845, the index of railway stock prices doubled. But the bubble burst, as they inevitably do. The railway index fell over 67 percent from 1845 to 1850—many companies collapsed owing to incompetence, poor financial planning, or fraud.</div>

This was called the dot-com boom.26 The NASDAQ index of technology stocks jumped five-fold between 1995 and 2000. For the first time in recent capital market history, losing money seemed to be the key to success. In October 1999, just six months before the bubble burst, the market value of 199 internet stocks tracked by Mary Meeker, Morgan Stanley’s internet analyst, was $450 billion. All these businesses were essentially start-ups; they had been created in the previous two to five years. More remarkably, their combined revenue was only $21 billion, and their cumulative loss was a staggering $6.2 billion. When discussing the initial public offering (IPO) of Priceline.com, a venture capitalist at Benchmark admitted, “We’re in an environment where the company doesn’t have to be successful for us to make money.”</div>

When Nalanda was established in 2007, the infrastructure boom was at its peak, and some of the leading companies were valued at billions of dollars. The Indian government had finally begun focusing on building roads, airports, power plants, and ports, and private and public equity investors seemed to have an unlimited appetite for these companies. But the infrastructure business in India was in a fledgling state in the late 2000s, the regulations were nascent and untested, and the basis of long-term success was unclear. The ensuing value destruction assumed epic proportions. Two of the affected infrastructure businesses were Reliance Power and Jaiprakash Power Ventures, whose market values were $29 billion and $23 billion, respectively, in early 2008.

            <div class="text-block original-text">For example, the Indian state and federal governments regularly resort to farm loan waivers.28 This involves forgiving the loans of farmers who have borrowed from government-owned banks. The loan waiver trend started in 1990 (the first waiver was for $1.4 billion) and continues today. Almost every state and federal government has gotten on the bandwagon over the past three decades. This may suit the governments and maybe even the farmers (I say “maybe” because farmers may not find it easy to borrow the next time they go to the bank). But it may be destructive for the minority shareholder.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">例如，印度各邦及联邦政府经常采取农业贷款豁免政策。这项措施旨在免除农民向国有银行所借贷款的还款义务。贷款豁免风潮始于1990年（首次豁免金额达14亿美元），并延续至今。过去三十年间，几乎每个邦政府和联邦政府都加入了这一行列。这种做法或许符合政府利益，甚至可能惠及农民（之所以说"可能"，是因为农民下次去银行时或许会发现借款变得困难）。但对于小股东而言，这可能是毁灭性的。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">It is not unusual for the Indian government to reward a senior bureaucrat by giving them a senior position at a government-owned business. Again, this may suit the bureaucrat but not a shareholder. We have nothing against bureaucrats, but the skill required to run a company successfully in a competitive environment is not the same as that needed to manage a district or devise a sound social policy for a state. Some businesses, especially the public sector oil companies, occasionally become cash rich, and the government then uses them as a piggy bank to manage their fiscal deficit. It suits the government, but how can this be beneficial for a shareholder? It is not that the government objectives are “wrong”—they make sense in the light of the multiple constituencies whose needs they are trying to meet. Their objectives are just different from ours.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">印度政府常通过授予高级官员国企要职来犒赏其政绩。这种做法或许符合官员利益，却与股东权益背道而驰。我们并非反对官僚体系，但在竞争环境中成功经营企业所需的才能，与治理地方或制定稳健社会政策的技能截然不同。某些企业（特别是国有石油公司）时常积累大量现金，政府便将其当作填补财政赤字的提款机。这固然符合政府诉求，但对股东有何裨益？政府的施政目标并非"错误"——考虑到其需要平衡多方诉求，这些决策自有其合理性。只不过，他们的目标与我们的诉求存在本质差异。</div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">102.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">The second category of owners we avoid religiously is the listed subsidiaries of global giants. A few decades ago, the Indian government forced all Indian subsidiaries of global multinational companies (MNCs) to list in the domestic market. Global MNCs like Cummins, Nestlé, Procter & Gamble (P&G), Siemens, Unilever, and many others have locally listed subsidiaries. Some are fairly large by Indian standards. For example, the Unilever subsidiary in India, Hindustan Unilever, is valued at about $70 billion.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">我们坚决回避的第二类企业，是跨国巨头旗下的上市子公司。几十年前，印度政府强制要求所有跨国公司在印度的子公司必须在当地上市。诸如康明斯、雀巢、宝洁、西门子、联合利华等跨国企业，都在印度拥有上市子公司。按印度标准衡量，其中不乏规模可观者——例如联合利华印度子公司印度斯坦联合利华，市值就高达约700亿美元。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">103.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">At first glance, it may appear that these MNCs should be aligned with the Indian minority shareholder. But there have been many instances when they weren’t. A few decades ago, a large global MNC with a listed company in India set up a separate fully owned subsidiary. This makes no logical sense because the global giant has only one listing in its home market. For a minority shareholder of the listed Indian business, this was a stab in the back because the fully owned subsidiary now does a significant amount of business. So why would the parent company do this? Isn’t it interested in value creation? Yes, it is. But it is more interested in the value creation of the parent, not the Indian-listed child. By creating a separate fully owned business, the global MNC has ensured that value accrues to the shareholders in its home market at the cost of the Indian minority shareholder. It gets worse. My friends who have worked for many years in this MNC have told me that its best managers are sent to the privately held business, not the listed company. What can a minority shareholder do? Absolutely nothing.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">乍看之下，这些跨国企业似乎应与印度小股东利益一致。但事实却屡屡背道而驰。数十年前，某家在全球主要市场仅有一处上市的跨国巨头，其印度上市公司竟另设全资子公司。此举毫无逻辑可言——对印度上市公司的小股东而言，这无异于背后捅刀，因新设子公司如今已承接大量业务。母公司为何如此行事？难道不重视价值创造？非也。只不过它更看重母公司而非印度上市子公司的价值。通过设立全资子公司，这家跨国企业成功将本应属于印度小股东的价值，转移给了母国市场的股东。更糟的是，据在该企业供职多年的友人透露，最优秀的管理人才都被调往私有企业，而非上市公司。小股东能如何应对？根本无能为力。</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">104.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Not all MNCs resort to such shenanigans, but enough do. Even if an MNC has behaved well in the past, there is no reason it wouldn’t change its mind in the future. There is a structural problem with an arrangement in which a parent also has a listed subsidiary. We have better things to do than to participate in this inherent conflict.
Last, we are not fans of the Indian conglomerates. The best known is the Tata Group, which Jamsetji Tata established in 1868.29 The group had twenty-nine listed businesses with combined revenues of $128 billion and a market value of $311 billion as of March 2022. They manufacture steel, gold jewelry, air conditioners, tea, and cars. Oh, and they also own and operate five-star luxury hotels from Mumbai to New York. There are many others, like Adani, Aditya Birla, L&T, Mahindra, and RP-Sanjiv Goenka. All typically run a gamut of unrelated businesses across a wide range of industries.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">并非所有跨国企业都耍这类把戏，但这么做的绝不在少数。即便某家企业过往记录良好，也无法保证未来不会变卦。母公司同时拥有上市子公司的架构存在根本缺陷，我们有更值得投入的事业，何必卷入这种内在利益冲突。

最后，我们对印度综合企业集团亦无好感。最著名的塔塔集团由詹姆谢特吉·塔塔创立于1868年，截至2022年3月旗下29家上市公司总营收达1280亿美元，市值3110亿美元。其业务涵盖钢铁冶炼、黄金珠宝、空调设备、茶叶种植、汽车制造，甚至在孟买至纽约等地经营五星级豪华酒店。其他诸如阿达尼、阿迪亚·博拉、L&T、马恒达、RP-Sanjiv Goenka等集团，通常也都横跨多个互不关联的产业领域。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">We believe that value creation is possible only through sustained focus. However, while focus is necessary, it does not guarantee success in a competitive world; most focused businesses aren’t successful. So how does one achieve excellence in multiple entities across entirely different industries? It’s hard but not impossible. One of the world’s leading technology services businesses is a Tata Group company called TCS, whose market value of around $150 billion was about 25 percent more than that of IBM in mid-2022. You may have seen its name splashed across Manhattan in November in the years it sponsored the New York City Marathon. TCS is the exception that proves the rule.
Maybe the Indian conglomerates will succeed in creating great businesses across their entire portfolios one day. But we are unwilling to wait for that glorious future.
But You Would Have Missed Tesla!
Yup. We would have.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">我们坚信，唯有持续专注才能创造价值。但专注虽是必要条件，在竞争激烈的世界中却不足以确保成功——多数专注的企业并未取得成功。那么，如何在完全不同的行业中实现多家企业的卓越成就？这很难，但并非不可能。全球领先的科技服务企业之一便是塔塔集团旗下的TCS公司，2022年年中其约1500亿美元的市值比IBM高出约25%。若您见过纽约马拉松赞助年份里曼哈顿满街的TCS标志，便会明白这家公司正是验证规律的例外。  
或许印度企业集团终有一日能在所有业务领域打造伟大企业，但我们不愿等待那个辉煌的未来。  

但你会错过特斯拉啊！  
没错。我们确实会。

Are there any businesses left for us to invest in? In India, not many. At Nalanda, our shortlist comprises seventy-five to eighty companies out of a universe of about eight hundred with a market value of more than $100 million.
Except for filial love, nothing in life comes free. Nalanda’s approach has a trade-off that many of you may find unacceptable.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">我们规避一长串风险清单。这是投资策略的核心要素：不投资骗子经营的企业，厌恶扭亏为盈的转型，尽可能远离杠杆，拒绝与并购狂徒为伍，无法理解快速迭代的行业，也不与利益不一致的所有者为伍。如此还能剩下多少可投企业？在印度，屈指可数。在Nalanda，我们的候选名单仅包含75至80家公司——从约800家市值超1亿美元的企业中筛选而出。

The CEO looks as impressive as the car he makes. But in 2017, Tesla had a net debt of about $7 billion and had suffered an operating loss of $1.6 billion. The company was also burning cash very fast—it had consumed $4.1 billion during the year. The traditional car businesses like BMW, Ford, GM, and Toyota had not yet entered the electric vehicle fray, but they had announced big plans. We abhor debt in general, but debt in a loss-making company with negative free cash flow in a fast-changing industry? One can get fired at Nalanda for proposing an investment in a business like this.

            <div class="text-block original-text">When we started Nalanda in 2007, there was a lot of buzz around a company called Eicher Motors led by a young, dynamic guy called Siddhartha Lal. Lal had inherited a hodgepodge of poor-quality businesses from his father in 2004. They manufactured motorcycles, footwear, garments, tractors, trucks, auto components, and a few other products, and none was an industry leader. In a remarkably bold strategic move, Lal decided to divest thirteen of the fifteen businesses to focus on just two products: trucks and motorcycles.30
Almost every analyst was gung ho about the future of Eicher; they were all taken in by its dynamic leader who was aggressively culling businesses, something that Indian firms rarely did. However, in 2007, this was a turnaround story with no empirical evidence of success. The company’s biggest hit, the Enfield Classic motorcycle, was launched only in 2010.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">2007年我们创建Nalanda基金时，围绕西达尔特·拉尔领导的艾彻汽车公司曾引发热议。这位年轻有为的掌舵人2004年从父亲手中继承了一系列经营不善的产业，涉及摩托车、鞋类、服装、拖拉机、卡车、汽车零部件等多个领域，却没有一项业务占据行业领先地位。拉尔做出了极为大胆的战略决策——剥离十五项业务中的十三项，仅保留卡车和摩托车两大核心产品。  
当时几乎所有分析师都对艾彻的未来充满狂热，这位锐意削减业务的年轻领袖令他们倾倒，毕竟如此果断的瘦身在印度企业界实属罕见。但截至2007年，这场转型仍缺乏成功实证——公司最畅销的皇家恩菲尔德经典摩托车，直到2010年才正式面世。</div>

If you had listened to what we had to say about the business, you would not have invested. Your opportunity loss? Seventy times your money from 2007 until 2021.
Tesla and Eicher Motors are the kinds of type II error we will inevitably commit because we reject highly indebted businesses, rapidly evolving industry landscapes, and turnarounds. But we will not change our approach. For every Tesla and Eicher, hundreds of unproven business models and turnaround stories are unceremoniously consigned to the dustbin of history. We believe our success is contingent upon our being comfortable with missing out on Teslas and Eichers because on average, avoiding type I errors works wonders over the long term. It has done so for us.

            <div class="text-block simplified-text">我们决定不对该企业进行投资。到2010年代，这家公司的摩托车已在印度消费者心中成为文化符号，销量从2009年仅5.2万辆暴增至2019年的82.2万辆——实现了十六倍增长。

若当初听从我们的建议，您将错失投资良机。机会成本是多少？从2007到2021年，您本可获得七十倍收益。

特斯拉和皇家恩菲尔德这类企业正是我们必然犯下的第二类错误，因为我们排斥高负债企业、快速迭代的行业格局及扭亏为盈的案例。但我们不会改变策略。每一个特斯拉或皇家恩菲尔德背后，都有数百个未经验证的商业模式和转型故事被历史无情淘汰。我们相信，成功正源于坦然错过这些特例——长期来看，避免第一类错误才能创造奇迹。这一原则始终指引着我们前行。</div>

Whenever a bumblebee landed on a flower with a crab spider, the spider “captured” the bumblebee between its foam pincers. Within a few seconds, the robotic spider released the bee. The team found that the bumblebees soon started committing more type II errors: they started avoiding flowers even where there were no spiders, thereby reducing their foraging efficiency. In the wild, this instinct to avoid danger at the cost of going hungry must have played a significant role in the tremendous success of the species over millions of years.
If the bumblebee can, why can’t we?
Chapter Summary
Evolutionary theory has taught me that . . .
. . . the first and probably most important step in reimagining investing is to learn how not to invest.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">科学家们建造了一座人造花园，里面放置了人工花朵和一些机器蟹蛛。他们将部分蜘蛛隐藏起来，另一些则保持可见。每当熊蜂落在藏有蟹蛛的花朵上时，蜘蛛就会用泡沫钳"抓住"它，几秒钟后再释放。研究团队发现，熊蜂很快开始犯更多II类错误：它们开始回避所有花朵，即便没有蜘蛛的地方也不例外，从而降低了觅食效率。在自然界中，这种宁可挨饿也要规避风险的本能，必定对这个物种数百万年来的巨大成功起到了关键作用。

既然熊蜂能做到，我们为何不能？

本章小结
进化论教会我......
......重新构想投资的第一步，或许也是最关键的一步，是学会不投资。</div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">112.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">1. Living things prioritize survival over everything else. In the animal world, this applies to prey and predator. Plants give up on opportunities to grow by redirecting resources when survival is at stake.
2. Millions of years of evolution have programmed the organic world to minimize errors of commission in favor of errors of omission.
3. Buffett’s two rules of investing (never lose money, and don’t forget to never lose money) are essentially a diktat for eliminating significant risks.
4. At Nalanda, we want to be permanent owners of high-quality businesses. Hence, we want to minimize risk before maximizing returns.
5. Just like the living world, we forgo potentially juicy opportunities if the risk of losing our capital is high.
6. We do this by avoiding crooks, turnarounds, high debt, serial acquirers, fast-changing industries, and unaligned owners. I believe we can be better investors only if we are better “rejectors.”</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">1. 生物将生存置于万物之上。在动物世界，这条法则对猎食者与猎物同样适用。当生存受到威胁时，植物会放弃生长机会以重新分配资源。

2. 数百万年的进化历程，让有机界形成了"宁可错过也不犯错"的生存程序。

3. 巴菲特的投资两法则（第一条：永远不要亏钱；第二条：永远记住第一条），本质上是消除重大风险的铁律。

4. 在那烂陀资本，我们致力于成为优质企业的永久所有者。因此在追求收益最大化之前，我们首先要将风险最小化。

5. 正如生命界的生存法则，当资本损失风险过高时，我们同样会放弃那些看似诱人的机会。

6. 我们通过规避以下情况来实现这一原则：欺诈者、困境反转企业、高负债公司、连环收购者、快速变迁的行业以及利益不一致的所有者。我坚信，唯有成为更优秀的"拒绝者"，才能成为更卓越的投资者。</div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">113.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">7. One downside of this approach is that we occasionally walk away from a potentially attractive investment. We are willing to live with this downside.
Section II
BUY HIGH QUALITY AT A FAIR PRICE
This section describes and, using evolutionary theory, justifies our
buying philosophy at Nalanda. For many investors, identifying the right business to buy at the right time is almost all there is to investing. Switch on CNBC, open a financial newspaper, or read a blog, and you will witness a lot of time spent and ink spilled on companies to buy. This is unfortunate. As we have already seen in section I, not buying is an equally—if not more—important skill.
There is also a profound conundrum about the buying strategy advocated by most fund managers. Everyone seems to spout the exact same philosophy as this section’s topic: Buy high quality at a fair price. I challenge you to find me a fund manager who professes to buy poor-quality businesses at high prices.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">7. 这种做法的缺点在于，我们偶尔会错失一些潜在的有吸引力的投资机会。但我们愿意接受这一弊端。

第二部分  
以合理价格买入优质资产  
本部分将阐述并运用进化论来论证Nalanda的投资理念。对许多投资者而言，在正确时机选中正确的投资标的几乎等同于投资本身。打开CNBC频道、财经报纸或博客，你会发现大量笔墨与时间都耗费在推荐股票上。这实在令人遗憾——正如第一部分所述，懂得不买入是同样重要（甚至更为重要）的投资技能。  

当前基金经理们推崇的买入策略还存在一个深刻悖论。所有人似乎都标榜着与本部分标题相同的理念："以合理价格买入优质资产"。但试问，你能找到哪位基金经理公开宣称要以高价买入劣质资产吗？</div>
        </div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">114.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Then why does the performance of professional investors vary so widely? One reason—not the only one, but a crucial one—is that our community has wildly different opinions on the meaning of “high,” “quality,” and “fair.” In this section, with many evolutionary theory elements as a backdrop, I will clarify the meaning of these words as they apply to Nalanda. I will discuss what we buy in chapters 2 to 4 and how we buy in chapters 5 to 7.
Let’s begin. In Siberia.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">那么，为何专业投资者的表现差异如此悬殊？一个原因——并非唯一，但至关重要——在于我们这一群体对"高"、"品质"和"公平"的理解天差地别。本节将以大量进化论元素为背景，阐明这些词语在应用于那烂陀时的具体含义。第二至第四章将探讨我们买什么，第五至第七章将阐述我们如何买。

让我们开始吧。从西伯利亚说起。</div>
