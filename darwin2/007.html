The sexes of many animals incessantly call for each other during the breeding-season; and not in a few cases, the male endeavours thus to charm or excite the female. This, indeed, seems to have been the primeval use and means of development of the voice, as I have attempted to show in my “Descent of Man.”
Charles Darwin, The Expression of Emotion in Man and Animals, chapter 4, “Means of Expression in Animals”
Fechheimer is exactly the sort of business we like to buy. Its economic record is superb. . . . You may be amused to know that neither Charlie nor I have been to Cincinnati, headquarters for Fechheimer, to see their operation. . . . If our success were to depend upon insights we developed through plant inspections, Berkshire would be in big trouble. Rather, in considering an acquisition, we attempt to evaluate the economic characteristics of the business—its competitive strengths and weaknesses—and the quality of people we will be joining.
Warren Buffett, annual letter to shareholders, 1985
The Oracle from Omaha takes the crown for best investor in the world. He started managing $105,000 for family and friends in 1956 and has compounded it to half a trillion dollars today.
Who is the second best?
Anthony Bolton is not widely known, but in my view, he is the sole occupier of second place in the pantheon of all-time investment greats. He was the superstar fund manager from the United Kingdom with a track record rivaling Buffett’s. Bolton managed the Fidelity Special Situations Fund for twenty-eight years, from 1979 until 2007, and achieved an annualized return of 19.5 percent when the market yielded about 13.5 percent. A sum of £1,000 would have compounded to £147,000 during his tenure. If there is a better dictionary definition of “stellar,” I have yet to see it.
In 2010, he came back from retirement to launch a £460 million fund. However, the fund significantly underperformed the market and lost 14 percent over the next three years. Bolton had to leave the fund in 2014.
How could a genius who had beaten the market over almost three decades suffer so dismally? Was it just bad luck, or did he slip up? If so, where? If this happened to Bolton, is anyone immune from such a fate?
The Blessings and Perils of Signals
If you are as ardent a fan of the National Geographic channel as I am, some of or all the following scenes should be familiar to you. A male lion roaring to assert his dominance over a pride; female baboons with their bright sexual swelling indicating their readiness to mate; bees performing their waggle dance to show the direction and distance of flowers; a female elephant caressing her calf to soothe him; a deep-sea squid emitting light to attract prey; and a meerkat squealing to warn her family of a predatory eagle.
All these are examples of signals, and no textbook on evolutionary theory is complete without a lengthy discussion on them.1 Signals emitted by a “sender” have explicitly evolved to alter the behavior of the “receiver” and are used to communicate with and influence the behavior of prey, predators, mates, competitors, friends, and family. A signal can take myriad forms: touch, sound, color, motion, light, odor, or some combination of these. No organism could live without emitting and receiving signals, but a misdirected or misread signal can also lead to death. Although evolution has honed the signal emitting and receiving skills and instincts of animals and plants over millions of years, the race to deceive a predator or beat a competitor for food or a mate is never over.
This book is about an integral part of the financial services industry—an industry that deserves its reputation for dishonesty and deceit. Few have described the sad state of our industry better than Fred Schwed in his hard-hitting, timeless classic Where Are the Customers’ Yachts? Those of you who suffered through the global financial crisis of 2008 have probably exhausted every cuss word for us finance folks. If you aren’t an evolutionary biologist, you probably believe that deception is the sole preserve of our cunning species. Not so.
Let’s start with green frogs.
Green frogs, like most animals, have a short window for mating. During this crucial period, males need to defend their territories aggressively to maximize their reproductive success. Larger males advertise their size and dominance by making calls (croaks, if you prefer) at a lower frequency than smaller frogs. Thus, a male green frog who is evolutionarily programmed to avoid larger and stronger green frogs will not enter a territory filled with low-frequency croaks. His brain equates low-frequency croaks with unbeatable rivals.
What do you do if you are a small green frog? Live without a mate and die a virgin? No, sir! Some small green frogs have found a way to lower their signals’ pitch, thereby communicating that they are larger than they actually are.2 This ability enables them to preserve their territories by fooling the larger males. Some small green frogs hijack a low-frequency croak to send a dishonest signal, thereby gaining evolutionary advantage. This dishonest signal is easy to produce and imposes a very small cost on the signaler, the small green frog.
If you think the green frogs are devious little dudes, you should be suitably impressed with the shenanigans of the fantastic fiddler crabs.
Fiddler crabs have gone one up on green frogs by dishonestly signaling their prowess to females and other males.3 Male fiddler crabs have a single large claw that serves the dual purpose of fighting other males and attracting females. Researchers have found that females differentially prefer males with larger claws, and these well-endowed males also successfully deter other male rivals. When a male loses his large claw in a fight, he usually grows a new claw that is lighter in weight, slenderer, and weaker. However, its size can still be impressive, and it can look as potent as the previous heavier and deadlier claw.
These regenerated claws fool both sexes. The females do not differentiate between these impostors and the males with the heavier “real” claws. Even the males with the “real” claws don’t pick a fight with males with lighter and weaker but impressive-looking regenerated claws. Researchers have found that up to 44 percent of males in a fiddler crab population can have regenerated claws. And you thought it was only us finance folks whom you can’t trust!
If you think dishonest signals are emitted solely by animals, think again.
Plants are masters of deception. Since they can’t run or hide, many of their survival strategies involve deceiving other plants or animals. Some of the best examples—or worst, if you happen to be a wasp—are certain species of Australian orchids.4 Australia has about 1,400 species of orchids, and around 250 of these have adopted the same strategy of deceiving male wasps to enable pollination.
Here is how it works. When a female wasp, who lives most of her life underground laying eggs, is ready to mate, she emerges from the ground and emits a distinctive pheromone that attracts the males. Many males typically descend on a female and start copulating in a frenzy. Nothing out of the ordinary here. Okay, agreed, a bit disconcerting, but you know what I mean.
Enter the orchid. Many orchid species have figured out a way to emit the same pheromone that a female wasp emits. What is the result? The male wasps end up copulating with orchid flowers, thereby brushing against pollen, which they carry to other flowers, where the unfortunate wasps “mate” again and leave the pollen behind!
I don’t want to give the impression that the living world is replete only with hustlers and cheats. Unlike green frogs, fiddler crabs, and Australian orchids, male guppies and coral snakes lead a more upright life.
Guppies populate the mountain forest streams of Venezuela, Trinidad, and Tobago. Whereas female guppies are plain and drab-looking, male guppies are quite colorful, and no two males have the same color pattern. I urge you to do a Google image search of male guppies to see how dazzlingly beautiful they are.
Scientists have experimentally demonstrated that females have a clear preference for brighter and more conspicuously red males with greater quantities of carotenoid pigments. More on carotenoids shortly. But conspicuous coloration comes at a huge cost to the males—their life.5 More colorful guppies are also subject to higher predation. If the males have dull colors, they won’t get to mate, but if they are brightly colored, they are likely to be hunted down. Talk about being between a rock and a hard place. Thus, brighter colors in a guppy are an honest signal of attractiveness to females. As Godin and McDonough succinctly state, “The viability cost associated with bright conspicuous coloration in male guppies potentially reinforces for females the reliability of this sexually selected trait as an indicator trait of male quality.”6
While a male guppy may attract predators by honestly communicating to females, the deadly coral snake deters its potential predators with its bright coloration.7 About ninety species of these fabulously colored and highly poisonous snakes are native to the tropics. They have alternating patterns of three colors: red, black, and yellow or white. This kind of aposematic (what a nice-sounding word from the world of biology!) or conspicuous coloration is quite common among many poisonous plants and animals. They are essentially broadcasting honestly to their potential predators, “Don’t you dare!”
But what would evolution be if not bizarre and fascinating? Nonvenomous milk snakes kept as pets have almost the same coloration and banding pattern of coral snakes. I bet that if you put the photographs of these two species side by side, you would be unable to distinguish the poisonous one from the pet.8 Try it.</div>

**段落一**  
许多动物在繁殖季节会持续呼唤异性；不少情况下，雄性试图通过这种方式吸引或刺激雌性。正如我在《人类的由来》中所阐释的，这似乎是声音最初的用途和发展动因。  
——查尔斯·达尔文《人与动物的情感表达》第四章"动物的表达方式"

**段落二**  
费克海默正是我们青睐的收购对象。其经济表现卓越……有趣的是，查理和我从未去过其辛辛那提总部考察运营……若成功需依赖实地考察，伯克希尔将陷入困境。我们评估收购时，侧重分析企业经济特质——竞争优势与短板——以及合作团队的质量。  
——沃伦·巴菲特1985年致股东信

**段落三**  
奥马哈先知摘得全球最佳投资者桂冠。1956年他为亲友管理10.5万美元，如今复利积累至五千亿美元。  
谁是第二？  
安东尼·波顿虽名声不显，却是投资圣殿中当之无愧的第二席。这位英国明星基金经理的业绩媲美巴菲特。他于1979至2007年执掌富达特殊情况基金28年，年均回报19.5%，远超市场13.5%的收益。千英镑本金在其任内复利增值至14.7万英镑。"星光璀璨"的释义莫过于此。  
2010年他携4.6亿英镑基金复出，但三年内业绩大幅跑输市场亏损14%，2014年黯然离场。  
为何这位纵横市场三十载的天才遭遇滑铁卢？是运气不济还是决策失误？若波顿难逃此劫，何人能幸免？  

**信号的馈赠与陷阱**  
若你如我般热衷《国家地理》频道，下列场景必不陌生：雄狮怒吼宣示统治权；雌狒狒以鲜红肿胀昭示交配期；蜜蜂摆动舞传递花源方位；母象轻抚幼崽安抚情绪；深海鱿鱼发光诱捕猎物；猫鼬尖啸预警猎鹰来袭。  
这些皆是信号案例。任何进化论专著必用长篇探讨：信号由"发送方"发出，旨在改变"接收方"行为，用以沟通并影响猎物、天敌、配偶、竞争者及亲族。信号形态万千：触觉、声响、色彩、动作、光线、气味或其组合。生物生存离不开信号收发，但错发误读亦可致命。尽管进化已磨砺动植物数百万年的信号本能，但欺骗天敌、争夺资源的博弈永无止境。  

本书聚焦金融服务业的本质——该行业素以欺诈失信闻名。弗雷德·施韦德在经典之作《客户的游艇在哪里？》中对此作了极致刻画。亲历2008金融危机的诸位，想必已用尽脏话痛斥从业者。若非进化生物学者，你或以为欺诈唯人类独有。谬矣。  

从绿蛙说起。  
如多数动物，绿蛙交配期短暂。此期间雄性需捍卫领地以延续基因。体型越大者鸣叫频率越低，彰显统治力。故进化程序驱使雄性回避低频蛙鸣领地——其大脑认定此声等同不可战胜的强敌。  
若身为小绿蛙，难道孤独终老？不！某些小绿蛙能压低鸣叫频率，虚张声势伪装大块头。此伎俩可愚弄大蛙保住领地。这类欺诈信号成本低廉，却带来进化优势。  

若觉绿蛙狡黠，招潮蟹的把戏更令人称奇。  
招潮蟹以欺诈信号超越绿蛙：雄蟹挥舞巨螯既为搏斗亦求偶。研究发现雌性偏爱巨螯雄蟹，而"装备精良"者确能威慑情敌。若雄蟹搏斗失螯，新生的螯更轻更弱，但外观仍显威猛。  
再生螯能欺骗两性：雌蟹难辨真伪，真巨螯雄蟹亦避战。研究显示招潮蟹群体中44%雄蟹持再生螯。此刻你是否恍悟——不可信者岂止金融从业者？  

若以为欺诈信号仅存动物界，请再思量。  
植物方为欺诈大师。因无法遁逃，其生存策略多倚仗欺骗。澳大利亚兰花即为典例——若你恰是黄蜂，此乃厄运之源。澳洲约1400种兰花中，250种采用相同策略：诱骗雄蜂授粉。  
机制如下：雌蜂毕生地下产卵，交配期出土释放独特信息素。众雄蜂循味而至，展开疯狂交配。此时兰花登场——其能模拟雌蜂信息素。结果？雄蜂与兰花"交合"，沾染花粉后又赴他处"交配"，从而完成传粉！  

切勿误认生物界尽属欺诈之徒。与绿蛙、招潮蟹、澳洲兰迥异，孔雀鱼与珊瑚蛇恪守诚信。  
孔雀鱼栖居委内瑞拉及特立尼达岛山林溪流。雌鱼灰暗朴素，雄鱼却色彩绚烂且纹路独一无二。谷歌搜索雄鱼图片，你会惊叹其华美。  
实验证实雌鱼偏爱体含更多类胡萝卜素、通体鲜红的雄鱼（类胡萝卜素后文详述）。但艳丽色泽需以生命为代价——越鲜艳者越易遭捕食。黯淡则无偶，鲜艳则丧命，实属两难。故孔雀鱼的亮色实为吸引雌性的诚信信号。如高定与麦克唐纳所言："雄性孔雀鱼鲜艳体色的生存代价，反而强化此特征作为择偶标准的可靠性。"  

当孔雀鱼以诚示美反招天敌时，致命珊瑚蛇却凭艳色震慑捕食者。近百种剧毒珊瑚蛇遍布热带，身覆红黑黄（或白）相间环纹。此类警戒色（生物学多美妙的术语！）常见于有毒物种，实为向天敌发出的诚信警告："尔敢！"  
然进化奇观岂容错过？宠物无毒乳蛇竟具珊瑚蛇的环纹。若并置两蛇照片，你断难辨毒。（不妨一试！）

Milk snakes have successfully evolved through natural selection to mimic coral snakes, thereby ensuring their survival.
I want to present a necessary qualifier here, which I will assert a few more times to avoid anthropomorphic confusion. The words “honest” and “dishonest” in the discussion so far do not communicate the intent of the signaler. They point to the effect of the signal on the receiver. When a signal fools the receiver, it is dishonest; when the receiver understands the signal for what it is, it is honest. Neither the guppy nor the milk snake possesses the ability to dictate its body color. The orchid is not deliberately releasing pheromones, nor is the fiddler crab consciously building a large fake claw. These creatures are all products of natural selection honed over millions of years.
For example, an ancestor of the harmless milk snake may have developed the coloration of the poisonous coral snake through a random mutation. These mutants would have had a higher survival rate than their nonmutated peers, thereby giving birth to more baby milk snakes with the same pattern. These babies, in turn, would have been safer from predators and would have successfully produced more offspring with the same colorful pattern, and so on. Over many generations, all milk snakes would come to have the same coloration as coral snakes. In doing so, they have perfected the dishonest signal.
The Handicap Principle Clarifies It All
While I call myself an investor, an evolutionary biologist would not be remiss in branding me a “signal decoder.” The only things investors can rely on to assess a company are the signals emitted by it—some direct and others indirect, some comprehensible and others bizarre, some ongoing and others delayed, and some quantitative and others qualitative.
Companies relay signals in the form of press releases, media interviews, analyst meetings, earnings calls, annual reports, dividends, buybacks, acquisitions, SEC filings, newspaper boasts, and so much more. Most investors receive the same signals from companies since the capital market regulators have ensured the standardization and transparency of communication. So how is it that the long-term performance of different investors—who are all within a small band of seemingly prodigious intellectual capacity—varies significantly? Among the many reasons for this variance, one that stands out for me is an investor’s ability to decode honest signals from dishonest ones (figure 7.1). Acting on a dishonest signal and ignoring an honest one can lead to hunger or death in the natural world, a fate not too dissimilar to a fund’s performance.

But how is an investor supposed to distinguish between an honest signal and a dishonest one?
Let’s turn to the Israeli evolutionary biologist Amotz Zahavi for an exquisitely elegant answer.
But first, a brief background on signals. In the early and middle parts of the twentieth century, ethologists (ethology is the study of animal behavior) believed that signals were essentially honest indicators of senders’ underlying motives. However, in the 1970s, two British scientists, Richard Dawkins and John Krebs, took an almost diametrically opposite view claiming that signals were best seen as a deceitful manipulation by a sender to alter the behavior of the receiver for the sender’s benefit.10 On the other hand, the receiver was trying to fathom the true motive of the sender and plotting its own moves. According to Dawkins and Krebs, this leads to an arms race in which the sender and receiver are constantly trying to outdo each other.
However, Amotz Zahavi rejected this pessimistic view of signals. In 1975, he proposed his famous “handicap principle,” which explains how and why honest signals can evolve in the natural world where animals are presumably trying to deceive one another.11 Zahavi’s profound observation was that when signals for a particular trait are costly to produce—he rightly termed such signals “handicaps”—and cannot be matched by another with a lower quality of that trait, they can be deemed “honest.” That may sound logical, but science, unlike the investment profession, needs empirical evidence to support its tall claims. The scientific community did not fully accept the handicap principle until fifteen years after the publication of the article in which Zahavi presented it.12 In 1990, two articles by the Scottish biologist Alan Grafen finally turned the tide in its favor.
The best route to understanding the handicap principle is through carotenoids. Carotenoids are a class of pigments ranging from yellow to orange to red. They also provide health benefits by acting as antioxidants and strengthening the immune system. Animals can’t synthesize carotenoids within their bodies and must procure them by eating plants, bacteria, or fungi. Carotenoids play a strong signaling role, and scientists have studied their effect extensively in three species: the house finch (a bird), the three-spined stickleback (a fish), and the guppy.
If the handicap principle is accurate, we should be able to confirm the following three hypotheses:
1. Females are differentially attracted to males with redder or brighter hues,
2. Males with a redder coloration are fitter than paler males, and
3. It is costly for healthy males to produce a deep red pigment.
In the species studied, researchers have shown conclusively that females react more favorably to males that display a deeper carotenoid pigmentation. Male house finches, for example, have three patches of carotenoid pigmentation on their body: on the crown, throat, and rump. Each patch varies in coloration from pale yellow to bright red. Experiments clearly show that female house finches prefer to consort with redder males whether this redness results from natural diet or artificial dyes. This finding supports the first hypothesis: receiver response.
To provide support for the second hypothesis (signal honesty), scientists demonstrated that well-fed house finches developed a deeper red coloration compared to those fed less nutritious food. When researchers exposed three-spined sticklebacks to parasites, the ones with a higher load of infectious ciliate had a significant decrease in red coloration. Other experiments like the one by Godin and McDonough described earlier have found evidence for the same phenomenon in guppies. Thus, deeper carotenoid pigmentation does seem to indicate better overall health.
Let’s now deal with the last and most crucial hypothesis: whether honest signals impose a cost on the signaler. Over the years, biologists have unearthed four possible costs of deeper carotenoid pigmentation. First, carotenoid levels in fish scales or bird plumage are directly correlated with the amount of carotenoid in the animal’s gut. Thus, the more time an animal spends eating nutritious food, the redder the pigment but also the greater the cost incurred. Second, since carotenoids have health benefits and are needed to ward off disease and parasites, redirecting them from the gut to dead tissues like scales or feathers for display purposes is a costly maneuver for the animal. Third, displaying carotenoid pigmentation involves the cost of processing carotenoids in the gut and then transporting them to the feathers or scales. Hence, only those animals that have eaten enough nutritious food are up to the task. The fourth obvious cost is the risk of death: A deep red coloration charms females and foes alike. In laboratory experiments, trout have been shown to be more likely to attack redder sticklebacks, and blue acara cichlids are more likely to kill guppies with greater carotenoid pigmentation.
Thus, according to the handicap principle, redder male house finches attract more mates presumably because their message to females is, “Look how healthy and virile I am; I am so darned red!” It would be very costly and potentially even suicidal for a weak or diseased house finch to produce more carotenoid pigmentation given the diversion of resources required.
Obviously, male house finches do not consciously “decide” to produce redder colors; the healthier ones simply have enough nutritional resources to produce the pigmentation, and the weaker ones don’t. Ditto for the brightly colored male guppy in the example mentioned earlier. Or the dude with the shiny red Ferrari. All of them show off ornaments that are very expensive to produce or procure and hence accurately communicate the signaler’s well-being.
And herein lies Zahavi’s lesson for us investors: Lend credence only to those signals from companies that are costly to produce.
That, however, is easier said than done. What does “costly to produce” mean in the context of a corporate environment? What is the equivalent of a peacock’s resplendent tail? A shiny new corporate headquarters, an industry award, a growing market value, a CEO’s Forbes profile, or something else? I am a practicing investor, not a finance academic. I cannot offer a regression model proven to be statistically relevant, but I can offer the practical ways in which my team and I distinguish between honest and dishonest signals.
Dishonest Signals Galore</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">以下是根据要求翻译的文本：

这种欺骗性信号传递被称为贝氏拟态，由亨利·沃尔特·贝茨于1860年代在巴西蝴蝶中首次发现。贝氏拟态中，无毒物种通过模拟有毒物种的体色来驱避天敌。例如乳蛇通过自然选择成功演化出与珊瑚蛇相似的斑纹，从而确保物种延续。
需要特别说明的是（后续将多次强调以避免拟人化误解），前文所述"诚实"与"欺骗"并非指信号传递者的主观意图，而是指信号对接收方产生的客观效果。当信号误导接收方即为欺骗性，当接收方正确解读信号则为诚实性。无论是孔雀鱼还是乳蛇，都无法自主控制体色；兰花不会刻意释放信息素，招潮蟹也无意识建造巨型螯肢——这些都是百万年自然选择塑造的结果。
以乳蛇为例：某条无毒乳蛇祖先可能因基因突变意外获得类似珊瑚蛇的体色。这些变异体比普通乳蛇存活率更高，从而繁衍出更多具相似斑纹的后代。这些后代继续获得生存优势并扩大种群规模，经世代演化最终形成与珊瑚蛇完全一致的警戒色，由此完善了欺骗性信号传递机制。

**累赘原理揭示本质**
尽管我自称投资者，进化生物学家称我为"信号破译者"亦不为过。投资者评估企业的唯一依据就是企业释放的信号——这些信号或直接或隐晦，或明晰或费解，或持续或延迟，或量化或抽象。
企业通过新闻稿、媒体访谈、分析师会议、财报电话会、年报、股息、回购、并购、SEC申报、报刊宣传等渠道传递信息。由于资本市场监管要求信息标准化与透明化，多数投资者接收的信号源基本相同。那么为何智力水平相当的投资者群体长期业绩差异显著？核心差异在于甄别信号真伪的能力（图7.1）。自然界中误判欺骗性信号将导致饥饿或死亡，这与基金业绩崩塌的本质如出一辙。
*图7.1展示内容略*
投资者如何区分信号真伪？以色列进化生物学家阿莫茨·扎哈维的"累赘原理"给出了精妙解答。
首先简述信号理论背景：二十世纪早中期，动物行为学家认为信号本质是传递者真实动机的诚实指标。但1970年代理查德·道金斯与约翰·克雷布斯提出截然相反的观点，主张信号是传递者为牟利而操控接收方的欺骗工具，接收方则试图识破骗局——双方由此陷入不断升级的博弈对抗。
阿莫茨·扎哈维摒弃了这种悲观论调。1975年他提出著名的"累赘原理"，阐释了动物界为何能演化出诚实信号：当某种特质的传递信号需要高昂成本（扎哈维称之为"累赘"），且劣质个体无法效仿时，这种信号即具备"诚实性"。该理论虽符合逻辑，但科学界要求实证支持。直至1990年艾伦·格拉芬的两篇论文发表后，累赘原理才获得广泛认可。

理解累赘原理的最佳案例是类胡萝卜素。这类从黄到红的色素具有抗氧化、增强免疫力等健康功效。动物无法自体合成，必须通过摄食植物/细菌/真菌获取。科学家在家朱雀、三刺鱼及孔雀鱼研究中发现：
若累赘原理成立，必须验证三个假设：
1. 雌性更倾向选择体色鲜亮的雄性
2. 鲜艳体色反映更强健体质
3. 维持鲜艳体色需付出高昂代价
研究证实：雌性确实更青睐类胡萝卜素富集的雄性。以家朱雀为例，其头冠、喉部及尾部的色素沉积从浅黄至鲜红不等，实验证明雌鸟偏爱红色雄鸟——无论红色源自天然食物或人工染色（支持假设1）。
为验证假设2（信号诚实性），科学家发现营养充足的家朱雀体色更鲜艳；感染寄生虫的三刺鱼红色素显著消退；孔雀鱼研究也发现类似规律。可见类胡萝卜素浓度确能反映健康水平。
最关键的是假设3（信号成本）：生物学家发现维持高浓度类胡萝卜素存在四重代价：1) 需耗费大量时间觅食 2) 将健康物质转移至鳞羽等死组织造成资源浪费 3) 色素代谢消耗能量 4) 鲜艳体色同时吸引天敌（实验显示鳟鱼更易攻击红色三刺鱼，丽鱼优先捕食高色素孔雀鱼）。
因此根据累赘原理，家朱雀通过鲜红体色向雌性传递信息："我的健康基因如此强大，才能承担这般鲜艳的代价！"体弱个体若强行维持高色素，既需资源转移又易遭捕食，实属致命负担。
显然雄鸟不会"决定"变红——健康个体自然具备显色资本，弱者则无力承担。前文的艳丽雄鱼如此，驾驶亮红色法拉利的人类亦如此：他们炫耀的都是代价高昂的特质，从而真实传递自身优势。

扎哈维给予投资者的启示是：唯有重视企业付出高昂成本的信号。
但实践谈何容易？商业世界的"高昂成本"如何界定？是新建总部大楼、行业奖项、市值增长、CEO登上《福布斯》，抑或其他？作为实战派投资者，我无法提供统计回归模型，但可分享团队鉴别信号真伪的实用方法：

            <div class="text-block original-text">Let’s start with real-life examples of dishonest signals; that is, those that do not reliably communicate the trait they are supposed to. A “dishonest” signal does not imply that the sender is dishonest, although they might be; it simply means that the signal may not communicate what it is supposed to. Just as in the natural world, an honest person in a business setting can send a dishonest signal without necessarily having a bad intention.
When we evaluate a business to make an investment or divestment, we ignore the following types of signals or assign them a very low weight in our overall evaluation.
Press Releases
On July 29, 2014, Apple’s press release claimed that the company had updated the MacBook Pro with Retina Display (note the capital “R” and “D”).13 Should investors have cared about this news?
Maybe you would have been impressed if you were a discerning consumer, but how would this announcement have helped an investor decide if Apple was a good company to buy? You could argue that the press release indicated Apple’s prowess in keeping up with the latest technology trends, and so it was, in fact, quite informative. But how many investors—or nontechies in general—even know or understand what “Retina Display” means? I don’t.
Even if Retina Display, whatever it is, were to turn out to be a cool new technology, how was anyone to conclude from this information that the MacBook Pro would become a success? And to belabor the point, even if an investor did understand what Retina Display meant, and even if they concluded from various sources that it was likely to be a great success, how would this knowledge help them decide whether to buy Apple shares unless they could accurately forecast the profits and cash flows to be made from the increased sales of the MacBook Pro as a result of this technology?
A press release is probably the most used—or should I say “abused”?—signal given out by companies. The reason? It does not cost anything for the company to be in the press regularly apart from the retainer for the PR agency, which is usually an annual fixed expense. Many companies resort to regular press releases and interviews to share news of product launches, management changes, strategy shifts, and organization changes.
First, I am deeply suspicious of companies regularly in the press. (Don’t they have anything better to do?) But even those that are not professionals at managing the press through their public relations consultants rarely have anything helpful to say for a long-term investor.
Second, press releases can be—and frequently are—more insidious than the harmless MacBook Pro announcement. Many press releases appear to reveal significant information that a long-term investor must absorb but turn out to be empty boasts at best and deliberate obfuscation at worst.
Take the example of a Unilever press release from January 20, 2015.14 The headline states confidently, “Profitable Growth in Tougher Markets.” A detailed look at the press release left me scratching my confused head. I assume you agree that developed markets like the United States and Western Europe should be classified as “tough” because they are mature, have high competitive intensity, and have growth challenges. But if you read the press release carefully, you will notice that sales in 2014 declined by 0.8 percent in developed markets. Sales did grow 5.7 percent in emerging markets (though even this growth was lower than in 2013), but I would not call emerging markets “tough.”
Interestingly, the press release fails to mention which markets, according to Unilever, are “tough” and which are “easy.” Maybe you disagree with me and prefer to call emerging markets tough. Alright, let’s go ahead with that definition. But then how does one explain a sales decline of 20 percent in the fourth quarter in China? A slowdown of this magnitude, especially in a market as large as China, may be relevant information for investors, but as we saw, it is nowhere in the headlines. Unilever’s overall sales in 2014, by the way, declined by 2.7 percent. Was this the cause for celebration that the press release seemed to imply?
The bottom line is that making investment or divestment decisions based on a press release can be harmful to a fund’s bottom line. We treat press releases as what they are: a cheap signal given by companies to make competitors envious and to attract investors, employees, and customers.
We don’t give them any importance.
Management Interviews in the Media
It was June 13, 2019. The fifty-one-year-old visionary CEO was giving an interview to Bloomberg’s Matt Miller on the sidelines of Europe’s most prestigious digital and tech conference in Berlin. His company was a giant in payment processing, and from being a scrappy start-up in the early 2000s, its soaring market value had enabled it to win an entry into the coveted DAX index in 2018. Its stock price had tripled over the past three years, valuing it at about €18 billion. Twenty-three of twenty-nine research analysts covering the company had a “buy” rating on it.
Over the years, the Financial Times business newspaper and some short sellers had raised issues about its accounting practices, but the company had brushed aside all the allegations. In this context, Matt Miller was conducting an impressive interview. Rather than fawning over the celebrity CEO, Miller posed some tough questions on the sources of the company’s growth, its questionable corporate governance practices, and the reasons for the persistent rumors about the company’s lax compliance processes.
The relaxed and confident CEO looked Miller directly in the eyes and answered every question with remarkable clarity and precision. He assured Miller that Asia was the primary growth engine, its new sales were up 160 percent, and, contrary to the popular view, it was also witnessing growth in Europe. The CEO came down heavily on his detractors, reminding Miller that his share price had delivered a 36 percent annualized return (!) over the past fourteen years. He was confident that his compliance staff of two hundred were world class and explained that the company was investing heavily in technology to enable digital monitoring of transactions.
Almost exactly a year after this interview, on June 23, 2020, the CEO was arrested on charges of criminal fraud. The company filed for insolvency on June 25, 2020.
The CEO’s name? Markus Braun. The company? Wirecard.
Braun and Wirecard had been lying for years. But Braun’s hero worship was so deep and widespread in Germany that the national regulator, BaFin, filed a criminal complaint against Financial Times reporters in 2019, accusing them of market manipulation. Braun was a national champion, so how could he be wrong? You can watch the Bloomberg interview on Bloomberg TV.15 Braun comes across as a well-meaning, smart, and thoughtful leader clearly well ahead of the competition on digital payments.
Yes, I know I am cherry-picking one management interview to show how useless they are as a species. But I hope you will not dispute that Braun showed remarkable skills as an interviewee. He reduced the complex global operations of Wirecard to sound bites like “scalable,” “digital payments,” “risk management,” and “innovation.” I am almost certain he resonated with viewers, many of whom were surely also investors in the company.
While I have taken an extreme example, it highlights two common features of almost all management interviews. First, they are an exercise in making the management look good. And many of them are good. But as you must know from your own experience, looking good is not the same as being good. Second, these kinds of interviews can provide us a lot of information about the interviewee (dog’s name and favorite dish included) and the company, but not a lot that is relevant to an investor. For example, Braun’s statements, “In many areas, we are pioneers,” and “We are concentrating on technology innovations,” may be of literary, academic, sociological, or cultural interest, but what do they tell me, an investor? Nothing. I should be impressed by these quotes as a viewer, but not as someone who wishes to invest in Wirecard.
Have you ever read management interviews that claim they aren’t innovative, don’t have the best business leaders, aren’t “leveraging” technology, aren’t customer focused, don’t treat their employees well, don’t listen to shareholders, make bad capital allocations, and ignore the value of making “sustainable” investments? I haven’t. But the fact remains that most of the businesses I have encountered in my life as a consultant and as an investor have been deeply flawed in more ways than one. They either don’t know it or won’t admit to it.
Excellence is rare in this world, including the business world. You just won’t know it if you are relying on management interviews.
I am not saying I don’t read (or listen to or watch) interviews of business leaders. I do. But I read them for the same reason I read articles on Brexit, running, films, and the latest Trump tantrum: to gossip with friends, to pass the time on a Sunday afternoon, and for general interest in our fascinating world.
Not for investing.
Investor Conferences and Road Shows
Assume for a moment that you have had no exposure to the equity markets. The industry is facing a major problem, and you are asked to solve it. The company management teams seem to be spending too much time entertaining questions from myriad investors, and serious investors complain that their calls to companies remain unanswered because the management teams are sick and tired of answering the same questions. The investors, as well as company management, waste a lot of time and air miles meeting each other across various cities. What would be the best way to ensure that company information is shared efficiently across all interested investors?</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">以下是根据要求翻译的书籍段落：

我们先看现实中"不诚实信号"的实例——即那些未能如实传递其宣称特质的信号。"不诚实"信号并非暗示发出者不诚实（尽管可能如此），仅表示该信号可能无法传达应有信息。正如自然界那样，商业环境中诚实的人也可能无意间发出不诚实信号。

评估企业进行投资或撤资时，我们忽略以下信号类型，或在其总体评估中赋予极低权重：

**新闻稿**
2014年7月29日苹果新闻稿宣称更新了"MacBook Pro with Retina Display"（注意字母大写）。投资者真该关注这消息吗？作为挑剔的消费者或许会印象深刻，但这公告如何帮助投资者判断苹果是否值得投资？你或许认为这彰显了苹果紧跟技术潮流的能力，确实传递了信息。但多少投资者——或非科技人士——真正理解"视网膜显示屏"？反正我不懂。

即便这项技术最终成为创新突破，仅凭此信息何以断定MacBook Pro必将成功？退一步说，就算投资者理解其含义，且通过多方验证认定其前景光明，除非能精准预测该技术推动的笔记本销量增长所带来的利润与现金流，否则如何据此决定购买苹果股票？

新闻稿堪称企业最常用——或该说"滥用"？——的信号。原因何在？企业定期发布新闻稿除支付公关公司固定年费外几乎零成本。众多企业频繁通过新闻稿和访谈宣布产品发布、管理层变动、战略调整及组织变革。

首先，我对热衷曝光的企业深表怀疑（他们没更重要的事做吗？）。即便那些不擅长媒体公关的企业，也很少能对长期投资者提供有价值的信息。

其次，新闻稿可能比无害的MacBook Pro公告更险恶——且往往如此。许多新闻稿看似披露长期投资者必须掌握的重要信息，实则最多是空洞吹嘘，最糟则是蓄意混淆视听。

以2015年1月20日联合利华新闻稿为例。标题信誓旦旦宣称"严峻市场中实现盈利增长"，细读内容却令人困惑。你应认同欧美成熟市场属"严峻"范畴：竞争激烈且增长乏力。但该新闻稿显示2014年发达市场销售额下降0.8%。新兴市场虽增长5.7%（增速仍低于2013年），但我不认为新兴市场称得上"严峻"。

耐人寻味的是，新闻稿未界定何为"严峻"与"宽松"市场。或许你不同意我的观点，执意称新兴市场严峻。好吧，姑且接受。但如何解释中国区第四季度销售额暴跌20%？如此幅度的下滑——尤其在中国这样巨大的市场——本应是投资者的关键信息，标题却只字未提。顺带一提，联合利华2014年总销售额下降2.7%。这难道值得庆贺？

核心结论是：依据新闻稿做投资决策将损害基金收益。我们视新闻稿本质为廉价信号——企业用来刺激竞争对手，吸引投资者、员工和顾客的手段。

我们不予重视。

**管理层媒体访谈**
2019年6月13日，51岁的远见CEO在柏林顶级数字科技会议间隙接受彭博社马特·米勒专访。他的支付处理巨头公司从2000年代初的草创企业崛起，2018年市值飙升挺进梦寐以求的DAX指数。三年间股价翻三倍，估值约180亿欧元。覆盖该公司的29位分析师中23位给予"买入"评级。

多年来，《金融时报》与部分做空者对其会计操作提出质疑，均遭公司驳斥。在此背景下，米勒的访谈令人印象深刻。他没有奉承这位明星CEO，而是犀利追问增长动因、存疑的公司治理，以及合规松懈传闻的根源。

从容自信的CEO直视米勒双眼，每个回答都清晰精准。他坚称亚洲是核心增长引擎，新增销售额激增160%，且欧洲市场逆势增长。他严词抨击批评者，提醒米勒其股价十四年来年均回报率达36%（！）。他自信拥有两百人组成的顶尖合规团队，并解释公司正重金投入交易数字监控技术。

访谈整一年后，2020年6月23日，该CEO因欺诈罪被捕。公司于6月25日申请破产。

CEO名？马库斯·布劳恩。公司名？Wirecard。

布劳恩与Wirecard多年造假。但德国对其个人崇拜如此狂热，以致国家监管机构BaFin于2019年以市场操纵罪起诉《金融时报》记者。民族英雄怎会犯错？你可在彭博电视台观看该访谈。布劳恩展现的形象是善意、睿智、深思熟虑的领袖，在数字支付领域遥遥领先。

是的，我刻意选取极端案例来揭示此类访谈的无用性。但无可否认布劳恩展现了高超的访谈技巧。他将Wirecard复杂的全球业务浓缩为"可扩展性""数字支付""风险管理""创新"等华丽辞藻。几乎可以肯定他引起了观众共鸣——其中不乏公司投资者。

虽属极端案例，却凸显管理层访谈的两大共性：第一，本质是管理层形象包装。许多人确实擅长此道。但如你所知，形象好不等于实质好。第二，此类访谈提供大量关于受访者（包括宠物名字和最爱菜肴）及公司的信息，却鲜有投资价值。例如布劳恩宣称"我们在多领域是开拓者""专注技术创新"，这些言论或许具文学、学术或文化意义，但对作为投资者的我毫无价值。作为观众或许会赞叹，但作为潜在投资者不会。

你可曾读过管理层承认自己缺乏创新、领导力平庸、技术应用失败、漠视客户、苛待员工、忽视股东、投资失当、拒绝可持续投资的访谈？我从未见过。但事实是，我作为顾问和投资者接触的大多数企业都存在多重缺陷——他们要么不自知，要么不承认。

卓越在商业世界实属罕见。若依赖管理层访谈，你永远看不到真相。

我并非不看企业领袖访谈。我会看，但动机与阅读英国脱欧、跑步、电影或特朗普闹剧的报道无异：为与朋友闲聊、消磨周日下午、满足对这迷人世界的好奇。

而非为投资。

**投资者会议与路演**
设想你从未接触股市。行业面临重大难题：企业管理层疲于应付无数投资者的质询，而严肃投资者抱怨电话无人接听——因为管理层厌倦重复回答相同问题。投企双方耗费大量时间与里程辗转多城会面。如何确保企业信息高效传达给所有相关投资者？</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">If you are a smart person (which you are; after all, you are reading this book, right?!), you will most probably come up with the following answer. Invite many companies and investors to a single location—preferably a city with good flight connections—and let them interact formally through presentations and informally at lunches and dinners.
Well, congratulations! You have the right solution. This is exactly what the industry does by running conferences ranging in length from one to five days. Tens, sometimes even hundreds, of companies converge to make a series of presentations to visiting investors.
Road shows are a scaled-down version of these conferences during which the company management typically visits investors at their offices. Since most investors have offices in large cities like New York, San Francisco, London, and Tokyo, a company can usually meet six to eight investors in a single day.
What do you think most company managers want when they meet investors? They want the investors to buy their stock so that the share price moves up. Are they likely to present a balanced view of their business? It would be easier to believe in Santa Claus. My experience tells me that most of these conferences and road shows are an excuse for the company to show off. In a thirty-minute presentation, the company management will sing paeans of their strategy for 29.9 minutes. They will spend the remaining 0.1 minute drinking water or, if they are feeling generous, mentioning a couple of risks in such hushed tones that you will miss them if you sneeze.
I know I am exaggerating, but not by much, I can assure you. And I don’t blame them. If I were them, I would behave the same way. A conference or a road show is a dishonest signal because it does not cost the management team anything to present an overly optimistic view of their company, and so that is what they do. It is a chest-thumping marketing jamboree, not a forum to evaluate investment opportunities dispassionately.
Do we at Nalanda attend conferences and meet management teams during road shows? We absolutely do. But we employ a stratospheric level of discounting to company presentations and treat these conferences and road shows as a starting point for evaluating interesting businesses, not as a shortcut to building robust investment theses.
One of the ways we use conferences is to meet our portfolio companies’ competitors. Are they launching new products? Are they entering new segments? What is their approach to acquisitions? How are they planning to allocate capital? Are they becoming better than the company we own? But we never exit a management meeting in this kind of dog-and-pony show claiming that we have found a winner or loser and that we should place an order to buy or sell.
Investor conferences and road shows are dishonest signals not because management are dishonest—most of them are upright folks doing their job—but because it does not cost anything to spin the best story possible in a forty-five-minute presentation to an audience that is partly brain dead from rushing from one meeting to another.
Earnings Guidance
Many publicly listed companies project their profits after tax (also called earnings) over the next fiscal year. For example, in January 2019, during their earnings call, they will project their earnings for the full year of 2019. In subsequent calls (usually held after every quarter), they update this guidance depending on their recent performance and outlook. Analysts and investors follow earnings guidance quite seriously, and stock prices react promptly to the under- or overachievement of this guidance.
Investors and analysts love earnings guidance from companies. In fact, according to an article from PR Newswire, 77 percent of the 180 analysts surveyed wanted companies to provide guidance.16 Analysts are smart folks, so you must be thinking that they can learn a lot from the future pronouncements of companies. Sadly, they don’t.
What do you think a management team’s projections for the next year are based on? In fact, on what basis does anyone make forecasts about the near to medium term? The recent past? A hope for a better future? Spreadsheet manipulation? All of the above? Take your pick. Earnings guidance is a dishonest signal even though the management may fervently believe in it. It is cheap, easy to produce, and needs little effort to deliver.
In my career spanning more than three decades, I have sat on the boards of more than two dozen companies ranging from a market value of $5 million to about $50 billion. At the beginning of every fiscal year, all these company management teams usually present their budgets for the year. And I don’t remember a single occasion when a management team hit its target. Let me repeat that: not a single occasion. I am not kidding. The businesses either exceeded their budgets or underperformed. And they had no way of knowing which would happen.
There is a simple reason why earnings are so hard to predict: multiplicative probability. Earnings—or profit after tax—is the last line item on a company profit-and-loss statement. We can calculate profit after tax after deducting from revenues the cash expenses, noncash expenses (like depreciation and amortization), financial charges, and taxes. Thus, the management needs to hit its target on all these line items to hope for an accurate earnings guidance.
Many of these are not even under the management’s control. For example, interest rates may change, thereby affecting the interest income or expense. A global company selling in international markets can significantly undershoot or overshoot its budget owing to currency movements.
But even the line items that you think are in management’s control aren’t usually so. Take revenues. Let’s say the management has confidently projected a certain level of sales for next year. But what if the economy grows faster than predicted? Or slower? What if the competitor launches a price war? What if one of the factories shuts down because of a fire? What if the company’s best sales manager, accounting for 7 percent of sales, falls ill suddenly? None of these “what ifs” is theoretical—they have all happened in businesses for which I have been a board member or investor.
One may now assert that the costs incurred by a business should surely be under management’s control. After all, costs are all internal, aren’t they? Nope. Take raw materials. A manufacturing company using a wide variety of plastics and metals is subject to commodity price fluctuations; a logistics provider is held hostage to petroleum prices; and a services company needs to bend to the vagaries of labor market prices, especially if it is using part-time staff. Sales and advertising expenses seem more controllable—a marketing manager can decide to spend $10 million on advertising next year, and that’s that, right? Not so fast. If a new venture-backed competitor emerges that offers a similar product at a 25 percent discount, the marketing manager may have to react by increasing the marketing budget significantly.
Recall your basic probability class. You will remember that when many events are supposed to occur simultaneously (X and Y and Z), the cumulative probability is arrived at by multiplying all the individual probabilities. Let’s assume that the management you are evaluating is truly unique in its ability to forecast, and their predictive accuracy is 80 percent. Thus, the probability of hitting the right earnings number, if it is to be broken into just five component parts (revenues, discounts, employee expenses, manufacturing expenses, and sales expenses) would be less than 33 percent (0.8⁵)! In reality, the number of line items before we arrive at the earnings number is much more than five. So how would it be possible, even for a world-class management team, to keep hitting its earnings guidance numbers every quarter or every year? It is almost a mathematical impossibility. So what is the point of the financial community’s laser focus on this number?
I do not blame company management or analysts for this disease. Yes, I call it a disease because it infects almost everyone in the asset management industry and prevents investors from performing to their full potential. The blame for this malady should fall squarely on us, the investment community, which exerts enormous pressure on businesses and sell-side firms to come up with a single earnings number.
A McKinsey analysis of earnings guidance reaches the following unflattering conclusion: “Our analysis of the perceived benefits of issuing frequent earnings guidance found no evidence that it affects valuation multiples, improves shareholder returns, or reduces share price volatility.”17 The beneficiaries of earnings guidance appear to be neither the investors nor the management—only the brokers! The reports concludes, “The only significant effect we observed is an increase in trading volumes when companies start issuing guidance.”
And that’s not all. The sad irony of earnings guidance is this: A company consistently meeting its earnings guidance should be seen with an even greater degree of skepticism.
Why? General Electric (GE).
In the latter half of the twentieth century, GE was one of the most revered companies on the planet. And under Jack Welch, the CEO of GE from 1981 to 2001, it scaled heights never seen by any company on the planet.18 Under his leadership, the company increased its market value more than forty times over two decades. In August 2000, GE’s market value was $601 billion, making it the most valuable company on Earth. By the end of 2021, it was a shadow of its former self, having lost about 85 percent of its value.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">好的，这是根据您要求翻译的书籍段落：

如果你是聪明人（你确实是，毕竟你在读这本书，对吧？！），你很可能会想到以下答案：邀请众多公司和投资者到一个地点——最好是航空便利的城市——让他们通过正式演讲和非正式的午餐晚宴进行交流。

恭喜你！你的方案完全正确。这正是业内通过举办时长一至五天的会议所做的事情。数十家，有时甚至数百家公司汇聚一堂，向到访的投资者做一系列演示。

路演是这些会议的缩小版，公司管理层通常会拜访投资者办公室。由于大多数投资者在纽约、旧金山、伦敦和东京等大城市设有办公室，一家公司通常一天能见六到八家投资者。

你认为大多数公司管理层在见投资者时最想要什么？他们希望投资者买入公司股票，从而推高股价。他们有可能客观地介绍业务状况吗？那还不如相信有圣诞老人。我的经验告诉我，大多数这类会议和路演不过是公司炫耀的借口。在三十分钟的演示中，公司管理层会用二十九点九分钟高歌他们的战略。剩下的零点一分钟，他们会用来喝水，或者如果他们心情好，会压低声音提一两个风险，以至于你打个喷嚏就会错过。

我知道我有点夸张，但我保证，夸张程度有限。我并不怪他们。如果我是他们，我也会这样做。会议或路演是一种虚假信号，因为管理层过分乐观地描绘公司前景无需付出任何代价，所以他们自然这么做。这是一场自吹自擂的营销秀，而非冷静评估投资机会的论坛。

我们那烂陀资本参加这类会议并在路演中会见管理层吗？当然参加。但我们对公司演示内容大打折扣，将这些会议和路演视为评估有趣业务的起点，而非构建可靠投资论点的捷径。

我们利用会议的方式之一是会见投资组合中公司的竞争对手。他们是否在推出新产品？是否进入新的细分市场？他们的收购策略是什么？他们计划如何配置资本？他们是否变得比我们持有的公司更优秀？但我们绝不会在看完这类“马戏表演”般的管理层会议后，就声称发现了赢家或输家，并立即下单买入或卖出。

投资者会议和路演是虚假信号，并非因为管理层不诚实——他们大多是尽职的正派人——而是因为在一个四十五分钟的演示中，向那些疲于赶场脑子已经不太清醒的听众，描绘最美好的前景无需付出任何成本。

**业绩指引**
许多上市公司会对下一个财年的税后利润（也称为收益）进行预测。例如，在2019年1月的业绩电话会议上，他们会预测2019全年的收益。在随后的电话会议（通常每季度召开一次）中，他们会根据近期表现和前景更新这一指引。分析师和投资者非常重视业绩指引，股价也会对指引的未达成或超额达成迅速做出反应。

投资者和分析师喜欢公司提供的业绩指引。事实上，根据美通社的一篇文章，受访的180位分析师中有77%希望公司提供指引。分析师们都很聪明，你肯定认为他们能从公司对未来发展的表述中学到很多。遗憾的是，他们并没有。

你认为管理团队对下一年的预测是基于什么？事实上，任何人预测中短期的依据是什么？近期的过往？对美好未来的期望？电子表格的操作？还是以上所有？任你选择。业绩指引是一种虚假信号，尽管管理层可能对此深信不疑。它成本低廉、易于制作，且发布毫不费力。

在我跨越三十多年的职业生涯中，我曾担任过二十多家市值从五百万美元到约五百亿美元不等的公司董事。每个财年初，所有这些公司的管理团队通常会提交当年的预算。而我记不起有任何一次管理团队达成了目标。让我再说一遍：一次都没有。我不是在开玩笑。业务要么超出预算，要么未达预期。而他们事先根本无法预知结果。

收益之所以难以预测，有一个简单原因：概率的乘法效应。收益（或税后利润）是公司损益表上的最后一行项目。我们可以从收入中扣除现金支出、非现金支出（如折旧和摊销）、财务费用和税费，从而计算出税后利润。因此，管理层需要准确预测所有这些项目，才能指望得到精确的业绩指引。

其中许多项目甚至不在管理层的控制范围内。例如，利率可能变动，从而影响利息收入或支出。在国际市场销售的全球性公司可能因汇率波动而大幅低于或超出预算。

但即使是那些你认为在管理层掌控范围内的项目，通常也并非如此。以收入为例。假设管理层信心满满地预测了明年的销售额。但如果经济增速快于预期呢？或者慢于预期呢？如果竞争对手发动价格战呢？如果一家工厂因火灾停产呢？如果贡献了7%销售额的最佳销售经理突然病倒呢？这些“如果”都不是理论假设——在我担任董事或投资者的公司业务中，这些都曾真实发生。

有人可能会断言，企业的成本支出肯定在管理层掌控之中。毕竟，成本都是内部发生的，不是吗？并非如此。以原材料为例。使用多种塑料和金属的制造企业受制于大宗商品价格波动；物流提供商被石油价格绑架；而服务公司则需屈从于劳动力市场价格的变化无常，特别是当其使用兼职员工时。销售和广告费用似乎更可控——营销经理可以决定明年花一千万美元做广告，仅此而已，对吧？别急。如果出现一家获得风投支持的新竞争对手，以75折提供类似产品，营销经理可能就不得不大幅增加营销预算来应对。

回想一下基础概率课。你会记得，当许多事件需要同时发生（X 且 Y 且 Z）时，总体概率是通过所有单个概率相乘得到的。假设你正在评估的管理层在预测能力上确实独一无二，其预测准确率达到80%。那么，如果收益仅由五个组成部分（收入、折扣、员工费用、制造费用和销售费用）构成，则准确预测收益的概率将低于33%（0.8⁵）！现实中，构成收益的项目数量远不止五个。那么，即使对于世界级的管理团队，又怎么可能每个季度或每年都准确达成业绩指引目标？这几乎在数学上是不可能的。那么，金融界如此执着地盯着这个数字的意义何在？

我并不因此怪罪公司管理层或分析师。是的，我称之为一种病，因为它几乎感染了资产管理业的每个人，阻碍了投资者发挥全部潜能。这种弊病的责任应完全归咎于我们投资界，是我们向企业和卖方机构施加了巨大压力，要求他们给出一个单一的收益数字。

麦肯锡对业绩指引的分析得出了以下不客气的结论：“我们对频繁发布业绩指引的所谓好处进行了分析，没有发现任何证据表明它会影响估值倍数、提高股东回报或降低股价波动性。”业绩指引的受益者似乎既非投资者也非管理层——只有券商！报告总结道：“我们观察到的唯一显著影响是，当公司开始发布指引时，交易量会增加。”

这还不是全部。业绩指引的可悲讽刺在于：一家始终能达成业绩指引的公司，反而应受到更大程度的怀疑。

为什么？看看通用电气（GE）。

在二十世纪下半叶，通用电气曾是全球最受尊敬的公司之一。而在1981年至2001年担任其CEO的杰克·韦尔奇领导下，它达到了任何公司都未曾企及的高度。在他的领导下，公司市值在二十年间增长了四十多倍。2000年8月，通用电气的市值达到6010亿美元，成为全球市值最高的公司。而到2021年底，它已失去昔日荣光，市值缩水约85%。</div>

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">5.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Many things went wrong at GE, and this is not the place to list them, but one of the most striking things about GE during the Jack Welch era was its ability to hit its earnings target quarter after quarter, year after year. Analysts and investors loved GE. When GE declared it would meet its earnings the next year, it always did. As Welch said in an interview with Carol Loomis of Fortune, “What investor would want to buy a conglomerate like GE unless its earnings were predictable?” The company had become so blasé and arrogant about “managing” its numbers that the CFO, Dennis Dammerman, was bold enough to admit to Fortune, “OK, we’re going to take these large gains and offset them with discretionary decisions with restructurings.” He was smoothening his profits in plain sight.
The managers were under enormous pressure to hit their earnings targets. When Jeff Immelt, the CEO after Jack Welch, took over the plastics division at GE and found that the previous management had been fudging the profits, he chose to keep quiet. He was a rising star within GE and knew that not meeting his budget was not an option.
GE had a special-purpose vehicle called Edison Conduit that was supposed to be independent of the company but wasn’t. GE Capital guaranteed Edison’s liabilities, effectively making it a GE company. Why did it exist? Its stated purpose was to issue commercial paper, but its main objective was to create profits out of thin air. It periodically bought assets from GE Capital at higher prices than the book value, thereby showing profits. But how can a company buy its own assets to show profits, you ask? Good question. Today it can’t—it would be considered fraud. But the company was exploiting an accounting loophole of the pre-Enron era.
In 2002, the Sarbanes–Oxley Act passed, and many accounting tricks being used by GE became illegal. Jack Welch had timed his retirement almost perfectly in 2001. Jeff Immelt, the new CEO, never got the leeway from the accountants that his boss had and kept missing investor expectations. GE’s stock price went into a decline that hasn’t been arrested more than two decades after Welch’s retirement.
I am not suggesting that all of GE’s problems resulted from its guidance culture, but I think it played a significant role. When business managers are hyper-focused on meeting quarterly numbers, their long-term orientation takes a back seat; when a company is desperate to make an acquisition just to meet its earnings, it can overpay for a bad asset; when a manager is unable to speak the truth about accounting obfuscations, they pile up over time.
Last, let’s assume for a moment that a company can accurately predict its earnings without any accounting shenanigans of the kind employed by GE. So what? Should it matter to a long-term investor that the next year’s earnings will grow at 5 percent or decline by 10 percent?
We base our assessment of a company on its riskiness, competitive moat, quality of financials, and management integrity—not on its ability to forecast earnings accurately. We know it is very hard to predict earnings consistently, so why measure anyone on it? We have never bothered to assess earnings guidance from companies and have tried to persuade many of our portfolio companies to cease providing guidance. The results, I will admit, have been mixed. Old habits die hard.
Face-to-Face Meetings with Management
In mid-2015, Valeant, a pharmaceutical company run by a McKinsey alum called Mike Pearson, was the darling of the stock market and had a market value of about $90 billion. Just five years before, in 2010, its market value was only about $5 billion.
There was no business magazine that had not covered the stupendous success of Valeant. Nothing could stop this juggernaut acquiring pharma companies and cutting costs to the bone to enhance profits. Investors loved Mike and his seemingly unbeatable strategy, and marquee investors like Pershing Square, Sequoia, and ValueAct were big fans.
Charlie Munger, however, was having none of it. He rightly spotted that Valeant’s debt-fueled acquisition spree was a recipe for disaster. Combined with Valeant’s numerous unethical business practices (e.g., raising the prices of life-saving drugs many times after acquiring them), he opined that Valeant would fail spectacularly sooner or later. In a May 2016 interview with Fox Business, Munger called the company worse than a sewer!19
Munger’s views irritated some of Valeant’s largest shareholders, including Bill Ackman, the CIO of Pershing Square. He wrote a lengthy letter to Munger in April 2015 requesting him to meet with Mike Pearson, but Munger refused. Munger did not need a meeting to detect the “honest” signals of Valeant’s corruption and incompetence. Valeant had its comeuppance soon after and by mid-2016 had lost 90 percent of its value. Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square took a loss of $3 billion on Valeant.
Why were so many experienced investors blind to the problems that Munger had highlighted publicly? Why could Munger correctly predict Valeant’s demise without meeting Mike Pearson when many of Valeant’s board members and investors continued to be passionate supporters? My hypothesis is this: Mike Pearson was a fantastic salesperson. Correction. He was probably one of the best salespeople to have enamored Wall Street.
The smartest people lost their sense of judgment when faced with Mike Pearson’s persuasive skills. Valeant’s honest signals of its myriad problems remained undetected or ignored in the light of the dishonest signals emitted by Mike Pearson in face-to-face meetings, which by definition were cheap to produce.
Again, I am not asserting that Mike Pearson was dishonest. Maybe he genuinely believed what he said. It doesn’t really matter. The reason Munger was right was that he knew that any face-to-face meeting is a dishonest signal.
This claim that face-to-face meetings aren’t a reliable signal may seem strange at first glance given the importance of management teams for most investors, whether they are venture capitalists, private equity funds, or mutual funds. Many investors take pride in judging management teams based on a single meeting, and if you are one such investor, good for you. I am not.
The odds are that many investors think they are good at judging people, but they generally aren’t. Let’s assume we encounter a genius who is genuinely able to judge a person’s character based on a face-to-face meeting. My assertion here is even if they possess this rare skill, it will be useless in a management meeting and will not enable them to become a better investor. The reason is simple: Any signal that management gives during a meeting is a cheap signal requiring minimal effort. And since it is cheap, the signal may be dishonest even if the management is not.
For example, management may believe that their product is high quality, and they will say so in a meeting. Would you believe their assertion, or would you do independent checks to assess the product’s quality? Management may genuinely believe that their recent underperformance relative to domestic competition is a result of their focus on overseas markets. If you are a good judge of people and conclude that management is telling the truth, would you take their stated belief to be true? Management knows what you want to hear, and quite often, that is what you will hear.
We do meet management teams. We use these meetings to build relationships and to understand their corporate history and some of their past decisions. We never use management meetings to build an investment case or test key hypotheses because we know we will hear what they want us to hear, not what we want to know.
Invoking Zahavi to Interpret Signals That Matter
It looks like we are in a bit of soup here. If we can’t rely on press releases, investor conferences, earnings guidance, or management meetings, what kinds of signals can we, as investors, trust?
Let’s go back to Amotz Zahavi, whose assertion about the natural world is highly relevant to the investing world: We should trust only costly signals emitted by companies because they are the only ones we can rely on. But what signals are costly to produce and hence reliable? Broadly, there are two.
We know the first one from chapter 5.
Past Operating and Financial Performance
I will not rehash the logic I outlined in chapter 5 for visiting the past to assess a business and industry; suffice it to say that we at Nalanda treat the past as one of two critical and reliable signals for our investment and divestment decisions. The past has happened. It is there for us to see. It is an undeniable signal of the company’s actions and outcomes. The problem, of course, is that investors seem intently focused on receiving signals about the future.
Let’s take the example of a ubiquitous phenomenon in the world of investing: conference calls.
I know I discussed conference calls in chapter 5, but it’s important to revisit the phenomenon in the light of honest and dishonest signals. A quarterly call is a strong signal sent by the management to the broader analyst and investor community. The CEO, CFO, and some other key business leaders typically attend the calls. If there is one place where you can get all your answers, this is it. Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Jack Dorsey formerly of Twitter, Tim Cook of Apple, Elon Musk of Tesla—all these business leaders regularly attend their companies’ quarterly calls.
Let’s take a concrete example. Chevron, one of the world’s largest oil companies, had revenues of about $140 billion and a market value of about $190 billion in 2019. The management held a conference call for investors and analysts on January 31, 2020, to highlight its performance.20 The analysts and investors asked twenty-nine questions. What percentage of these do you think were about the future? More than 70 percent.
Here is a small sample of these future-directed questions:</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">以下是符合要求的译文：

通用电气的问题层出不穷，此处无需赘述，但在杰克·韦尔奇执掌时期最令人震惊的是其持续达成季度与年度盈利目标的能力。分析师与投资者对通用电气青睐有加——当公司宣布次年将实现预期盈利时，从未食言。正如韦尔奇接受《财富》杂志卡罗尔·卢米斯采访时所言："若盈利无法预测，投资者怎会青睐通用电气这样的综合集团？"公司对"调控"数据的傲慢态度已深入骨髓，以致时任首席财务官丹尼斯·达默曼竟敢向《财富》坦言："我们正通过重组决策来抵消这些巨额收益。"他在众目睽睽之下平滑利润曲线。

管理层承受着达成盈利目标的巨大压力。当继任者杰夫·伊梅尔特接管塑料事业部，发现前任存在利润造假行为时，这位冉冉升起的公司新星选择了沉默。他深知预算目标不容闪失。

通用电气设有名为"爱迪生管道"的特殊目的工具，名义独立实则不然。通用电气资本为其债务提供担保，使其成为实质上的子公司。其存在意义何在？表面是为发行商业票据，实则旨在凭空创造利润。该工具持续以高于账面价值的价格收购通用电气资本的资产，从而虚增利润。企业怎能通过自购资产制造盈利？问得好。如今此举将被视为欺诈，但当时公司钻了安然事件前的会计漏洞。

2002年《萨班斯法案》出台后，通用电气惯用的会计伎俩多数沦为非法。杰克·韦尔奇于2001年功成身退的时机堪称完美。继任者伊梅尔特却未能获得前任享有的财务操作空间，屡屡辜负投资者预期。公司股价在韦尔奇退休后持续下跌逾二十载仍未止颓。

我并非将通用电气所有问题归咎于盈利预测文化，但其影响举足轻重。当管理者过度聚焦季度数据，长远规划便退居次席；当企业为达盈利目标仓促并购，往往溢价收购不良资产；当管理者对财务造假三缄其口，隐患便随时间累积。

退而言之，即便企业无需通用电气式财技就能精准预测盈利，对长期投资者而言，次年盈利增长5%或下滑10%真有实质意义吗？

我们评估企业基于风险系数、竞争壁垒、财务质量与管理诚信——而非盈利预测能力。既然持续准确预测盈利本就艰难，何必以此衡量企业？我们从不关注企业盈利预测，并力劝投资组合公司停止发布预测。诚然收效参差，毕竟积习难改。

**与管理层面对面**
2015年中，由麦肯锡背景的迈克·皮尔森执掌的制药企业威朗公司市值约900亿美金，堪称股市宠儿。而五年前的2010年，其市值仅50亿美金。

所有商业期刊无不报道威朗的辉煌成功。这架并购战车通过极致压缩成本提升利润，势不可挡。投资者追捧皮尔森的无敌战略，潘兴广场、红杉、ValueAct等顶尖基金皆为拥趸。

然而查理·芒格不为所动。他精准指出威朗债务驱动的并购狂潮暗藏危机，加之诸多违背商业伦理的行为（如收购救命药后多次提价），预言其终将惨败。2016年5月接受福克斯商业频道采访时，芒格斥其"比阴沟还污秽"！

此番言论激怒包括潘兴广场首席投资官比尔·阿克曼在内的威朗大股东。2015年4月阿克曼致长信恳请芒格面见皮尔森，遭断然拒绝。芒格无需会面便能识别威朗腐败无能的"真实信号"。威朗很快迎来报应，2016年中市值蒸发90%，阿克曼的潘兴广场因此亏损30亿美金。

为何众多资深投资者对芒格公开警示视而不见？为何未谋面的芒格能预见威朗崩盘，而董事与投资者仍执迷不悟？我的推论是：皮尔森实为蛊惑人心的销售奇才——堪称华尔街史上最出色的说客之一。

面对皮尔森的游说魅力，最聪慧的人也丧失判断力。威朗暴露的诸多问题信号，在皮尔森当面释放的"伪信号"前被忽视或掩盖——这些会面本质上成本低廉。

重申立场：我并非指控皮尔森欺诈。或许他真心信奉所言。但关键在于，芒格的正确源于洞见：所有当面沟通皆属伪信号。

鉴于管理层评估对风投、私募及共同基金的重要性，"当面沟通不可靠"的观点初看荒诞。许多投资者以单次会面评判管理层为荣，若您属此列，自然无妨。但我例外。

多数投资者自诩识人慧眼，实则不然。即便真遇能凭会面识人的天才，我仍断言：此罕见技能在管理层会面中毫无价值，无益投资决策。原因简明：管理层会面中所有信号皆属低成本输出。因其成本低廉，即便管理层诚信无虞，信号仍可能失真。

例如管理层确信产品质量优异并在会面中声明。您会采信其言，还是独立验证？若管理层真心认为近期本土市场表现逊色源于专注海外，即便您识人精准判断其诚实，是否采信其说辞？管理层深谙投资者想听什么，而您听到的往往正是这些。

我们仍会面管理层，但旨在建立关系、了解企业沿革及历史决策。绝不以此构建投资逻辑或验证关键假设——因我们深知所闻皆为对方意图传递之声，而非我们渴求之实。

**运用扎哈维理论解析有效信号**
我们似乎陷入困局。若不能采信公告、投资会议、盈利预测或管理层会面，投资者还能信任何种信号？

回溯阿莫茨·扎哈维的自然界法则——其洞见与投资世界深度契合：唯企业释放的高成本信号值得信任，因其具备可靠性。何种信号符合高成本特征？概有两种。

第一种已于第五章阐明：

**历史经营与财务表现**
第五章论述的"回溯历史评估企业与行业"逻辑不再赘述。简言之，我们那烂陀资本视历史记录为投资决策两大关键可靠信号之一。历史已成定局，清晰可考，是企业行为与成果的无可辩驳之证。症结在于：投资者往往执迷于获取未来信号。

以投资界普遍现象——电话会议为例。

第五章虽讨论过电话会议，但结合真伪信号理论重审颇具意义。季度电话会是管理层向分析师及投资者群体释放的强信号。通常CEO、CFO及核心业务领袖悉数出席。若说存在获取全部解答的场合，非此莫属。摩根大通杰米·戴蒙、脸书马克·扎克伯格、前推特掌门杰克·多尔西、苹果蒂姆·库克、特斯拉埃隆·马斯克——这些商界领袖均定期出席季度会议。

以具体案例说明。2019年全球油气巨头雪佛龙营收约1400亿美金，市值约1900亿美金。2020年1月31日管理层举行投资者电话会议通报业绩。分析师与投资者共提出29个问题。您认为涉及未来的占比几何？逾70%。

以下是未来导向型问题的部分样本：</div>
        </div>
    

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">6.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">• Can you talk a little bit more about how you think about volumes in 2020? (Remember that this call is from the start of 2020.)
• I was curious where else we could see some upside in the portfolio in 2020.
• As you continue to shed assets and capital intensity is lowered, just wondering how repeatable outsized dividend growth could be over the long term.
In and of themselves, the questions on volumes, potential upside, and potential dividend growth are important. But just because a question is important does not mean it has a good or reliable answer. I want to know my fund returns next year, but I would be foolish to pick a number.
Let’s take the questions on volumes and potential upside. Chevron management gave a lengthy answer to these queries but essentially said that volume growth would be in the same ballpark as in previous years. Little did they—or anyone else for that matter—know that the COVID-19 pandemic would strike or that the price of and demand for oil would drop precipitously. Chevron would end 2020 with a net loss of $5.5 billion compared to a net profit of $2.9 billion in 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2020, revenue had dropped to $25 billion from $35 billion a year earlier, a reduction of almost 30 percent. During the conference call, management predicted capital spending of $21 billion in 2020. The actual number? $13 billion.
All the questions related to Chevron’s performance in 2020 and beyond essentially turned out to be useless. I know I am being unfair because I have chosen the year of the pandemic to talk about the difficulty of making predictions. But by doing so, I want to highlight the absurdity of the financial sector’s focus on a company’s future. No business could have predicted the calamities of 2020, and Chevron was no exception.
We can assume that Chevron management are honest and willing to answer questions to the best of their abilities. But how can any signal they give about the future be anything but cheap, and hence dishonest, given that pontification of future events does not demand much effort? Any talk of the future is unreliable and just speculation.
If I were in a senior management position at Chevron and asked these questions, my replies would have been no different. The problem is not with Chevron. It is with us, the financial industry folks, who want to coerce the management of companies to do the undoable and then blame them when they don’t meet our impossible standards.
An honest signal is not “our margin will be 15 percent next year” but “our average margin was 12 percent over the last ten years”; an honest signal is not “we will have robust free cash flows starting two years from now” but “we generated free cash flow only one year in the last decade”; an honest signal is not “we will launch six new products next year” but “in our recent history, we have launched an average of one product every two years.”
No stories, no projections, just facts about the past.
“Because She Said So”
While most people show positive bias in evaluating themselves and their kids, they can be remarkably candid and accurate when it comes to analyzing other people and their spouses. As an investor, we have used this well-proven human quality to solicit positive and negative signals on companies. A good reputation is a very costly signal—and hence an honest one—because building a name for oneself in any industry consumes enormous management time and effort over many years, if not decades.
Therefore, before we make an investment, we spend many months speaking to dealers, competitors, ex-employees, suppliers, and industry experts to get a holistic understanding of a company and its industry. We consider these “scuttlebutt” signals to be sincere for two reasons.
First, in general, I have found that few people have an incentive to lie unless they bear a serious grudge against a company. If a competitor is impressed with the company you are evaluating, it will say so and give you many reasons for saying so. Second, once we have performed enough interviews with people connected to the company (but not necessarily from the company), we start to get a good sense of the management’s reputation and quality.
I learned a valuable scuttlebutt lesson in 2008, less than a year after starting Nalanda. We had become deeply interested in a manufacturing company in India with a market value of almost $2 billion. The company had a very high return on capital over its long history, claimed to design and manufacture products that others couldn’t, and had a roster of marquee clients. The financial community was all praises for the businesses. We met the management and came away suitably impressed with the articulation of its strategy and philosophy. Our analysis of past results and performance yielded only positive news.
We started talking to the company’s customers, who were largely in the health care sector. We were surprised when all the customers we spoke to categorized it as a commodity supplier, not a specialist manufacturer. They told us that they were buying from this company only because it offered the lowest prices, not because it sold the latest high-tech products. It was clear to us after a few customer calls that the company had been resorting to hyperbole when it touted the quality of its products and depth of customer relationships.
We also spotted a strange anomaly in its balance sheet. A number of receivable days of 270 seemed too high for a company that claimed to have a strong relationship with its customers. Why would customers take nine months to pay? When we asked the company, their glib response was that this was customary in the health care industry. During our scuttlebutt calls, we checked with the customers, and all of them told us that they were paying the company within 90 days as per their agreement. Where was the cash hiding for the remaining 180 days?
Our third scuttlebutt signal turned out to be the most damaging. We were able to interview the company’s previous head of sales who had resigned a few months earlier. When we asked him about company performance, he quipped, “You are financial sector folks. So maybe you can explain this anomaly to me. I was the global sales head and was responsible for 100 percent of company revenues. But my actual delivered sales numbers for the quarter were always much lower than what the company stated in its quarterly financial results. How could it be so?” We didn’t need to hear any more.
The market value of this business is down 98 percent from its peak in early 2008.
If we had relied only on the company’s stated past financial and operating performance and had not performed our extensive scuttlebutt research, maybe Nalanda would not exist today. It may not have been possible to recover from making a dud investment of $150 to $200 million.
As an aside, the great investor Philip A. Fisher first popularized the scuttlebutt approach in his 1958 classic, Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits. In chapter 2 (“What ‘Scuttlebutt’ Can Do”), he asserts, “The business ‘grapevine’ is a remarkable thing. It is amazing what an accurate picture of the relative points of strength and weakness of each company in an industry can be obtained from a representative cross-section of the opinions of those who in one way or another are concerned with any particular company.”
Truer words have rarely been uttered.
Back to Bolton
Let’s get back to the mystery of the underperformance of the £460 million fund launched by Anthony Bolton in 2010. I deliberately withheld a key piece of information from you earlier: Bolton launched his fund in China, not the United Kingdom. I don’t know what he was thinking, but having shown his mettle in the United Kingdom, I am assuming Bolton wanted a new challenge.
But China is not the United Kingdom, especially when it comes to the behavior and track record of listed companies (as an aside, India is not that different from China in this regard). You may have heard of Luckin Coffee, which was supposed to be the Starbucks of China. It claimed to have a more scalable model than Starbucks because it sold cheap coffee, primarily for takeout and delivery. It had positioned itself as a tech company because customers could order through its app. Many marquee investors, including one of China’s largest venture capital firms, Joy Capital, and Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, GIC, had invested in Luckin at a valuation of $1 billion.
The company went public in the United States in May 2019, and by January 2020, its stock price had reached $50, valuing the company at more than $12 billion. In late January, the famous short seller Muddy Waters released a scathing report on Luckin alleging that its sales numbers were falsely elevated.21 To make matters worse, Luckin’s auditor, Ernst & Young, unearthed fraudulent behavior by Luckin’s senior employees. By May 2020, the stock had crashed more than 95 percent.
Luckin, unfortunately, is not an exception. Chinese companies like China Agritech, China Green Agriculture, China Integrated Energy, GSX Techedu, iQIYI, Longwei Petroleum, Orient Paper, Puda Coal, and Sino Clean Energy have all been accused of accounting irregularities or outright fraud.22
There are probably as many explanations as there are “experts” to account for Anthony Bolton’s failure in China. Mine is this: Bolton confused the Chinese signals for British ones. He did not realize that the signals from many Chinese companies were fundamentally dishonest and that he should have been much more skeptical of their veracity.23
In an interview with South China Morning Post, the Morningstar analyst Zhao Hu pointed out that not one or two but three investee companies of Bolton’s China fund had reeled under accounting and product recall scandals. Bolton was accustomed to honest signals from British companies, but in Zhao Hu’s words, “Obviously, he had not discounted enough risk into his investments in those small, unproven Chinese firms.”</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">好的，这是根据您的要求翻译的书籍段落：

*   能否请您详细谈谈对2020年产量的看法？（请注意，本次电话会议是在2020年初进行的。）
*   我很好奇，2020年我们的投资组合中还有哪些方面可能有上行潜力。
*   随着贵公司持续剥离资产并降低资本密集度，我想知道长期来看，这种超额股息增长是否可持续。

关于产量、潜在上行空间和潜在股息增长的问题本身都很重要。但问题重要并不意味着就有好的或可靠的答案。我想知道我明年的基金回报率是多少，但随便挑个数字出来是愚蠢的。

就拿关于产量和潜在上行空间的问题来说。雪佛龙管理层对这些询问给出了冗长的回答，但本质上表示产量增长将与往年处于同一水平。当时无人知晓——或者说任何人都不知道——新冠肺炎疫情将会爆发，油价和需求将会暴跌。结果雪佛龙在2020年以净亏损告终，相比之下2019年是净利润。2020年第四季度，收入较上年同期的350亿美元降至250亿美元，下降了近30%。在电话会议中，管理层预测2020年资本支出为210亿美元。实际数字呢？130亿美元。

所有关于雪佛龙2020年及以后表现的问题，结果基本上都毫无用处。我知道这样说不公平，因为我选择了疫情爆发的年份来谈论预测的困难。但我想借此强调金融业执着于公司未来的荒谬性。没有哪家企业能预测2020年的灾难，雪佛龙也不例外。

我们可以假设雪佛龙管理层是诚实的，并且愿意尽其所能回答问题。但是，既然预测未来事件并不费力，那么他们给出的任何关于未来的信号，除了是廉价的（因此也是不诚实的）之外，还能是什么呢？任何关于未来的谈论都不可靠，只是猜测而已。

如果我是雪佛龙的高管，被问到这些问题，我的回答也不会有什么不同。问题不在雪佛龙。问题在我们这些金融业人士身上，我们强求公司管理层去做不可能做到的事，而当他们达不到我们那些不切实际的标准时，又去指责他们。

诚实的信号不是“我们明年的利润率将达到15%”，而是“过去十年我们的平均利润率为12%”；诚实的信号不是“两年后我们将产生强劲的自由现金流”，而是“过去十年我们仅有一年产生了自由现金流”；诚实的信号不是“明年我们将推出六款新产品”，而是“在近代历史上，我们平均每两年才推出一款产品”。

不讲故事，不做预测，只谈过去的事实。

**“因为她这么说”**

尽管大多数人在评价自己和孩子时都表现出积极的偏向，但在分析他人及其配偶时，他们却可能出奇地坦率和准确。作为投资者，我们利用这一经过充分验证的人性特点来收集关于公司的积极和消极信号。良好的声誉是一种代价非常高昂的信号——因此也是诚实的信号——因为要在任何行业建立声誉，都需要管理层投入巨大的时间和精力，往往需要数年甚至数十年。

因此，在投资之前，我们会花数月时间与经销商、竞争对手、前员工、供应商和行业专家交谈，以全面了解一家公司及其所在行业。我们认为这些“小道消息”信号是真诚的，原因有二。

首先，总的来说，我发现除非对某家公司怀有深仇大恨，否则很少有人有撒谎的动机。如果一家竞争对手对你正在评估的公司印象深刻，它会如实相告，并给出很多理由。其次，一旦我们对与该公司相关（但不一定来自该公司）的人进行了足够多的访谈，我们就能很好地了解管理层的声誉和素质。

2008年，也就是成立Nalanda不到一年时，我学到了关于小道消息的宝贵一课。我们对印度一家市值近20亿美元的制造公司产生了浓厚兴趣。该公司在悠久的历史中拥有极高的资本回报率，声称能设计和制造他人无法企及的产品，并拥有一系列知名客户。金融界对该企业赞不绝口。我们与管理层会面后，对其阐述的战略和理念印象深刻。我们对过往业绩的分析也只带来了利好消息。

我们开始与该公司的客户交谈，这些客户主要来自医疗保健行业。让我们惊讶的是，所有接触过的客户都将它归类为大宗商品供应商，而非专业制造商。他们告诉我们，选择这家公司仅仅是因为它提供最低的价格，而不是因为它销售最新高科技产品。经过几次客户访谈后，我们清楚地认识到，该公司在吹嘘其产品质量和客户关系深度时，一直在夸大其词。

我们还在其资产负债表上发现了一个奇怪的异常点。一家声称与客户关系牢固的公司，应收账款周转天数高达270天，这似乎太高了。客户为什么要花九个月才付款？当我们询问公司时，他们轻描淡写地回答说这在医疗保健行业是惯例。在我们的小道消息访谈中，我们向客户核实，他们全都表示根据协议，他们在90天内就会付款。那么剩下180天的现金去哪儿了呢？

我们得到的第三个小道消息信号被证明是最具破坏性的。我们设法采访了几个月前刚辞职的该公司前任销售主管。当我们问及公司业绩时，他反问道：“你们是金融界的人。也许你们能给我解释一下这个异常。我曾是全球销售主管，对公司100%的收入负责。但我当季实际完成的销售额总是远低于公司季度财报中公布的数字。这怎么可能？” 我们无需再听下去了。

该公司的市值较2008年初的峰值已下跌98%。

如果我们当初仅仅依赖该公司声称的过往财务和运营业绩，而没有进行广泛的小道消息调研，也许今天就不会有Nalanda了。一笔1.5亿到2亿美元的失败投资可能就足以让我们无法翻身。

顺便提一句，伟大的投资者菲利普·费舍尔（Philip A. Fisher）在其1958年的经典著作《怎样选择成长股》（Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits）中首次推广了这种小道消息方法。在第二章（“‘小道消息’的作用”）中，他断言：“商业‘小道消息’是个了不起的东西。令人惊讶的是，通过那些以某种方式关注某一特定公司的人们的代表性意见，你可以对该行业每家公司相对的优势和劣势获得多么准确的画面。”

很少有比这更真实的说法了。

**回到博尔顿**

让我们回到安东尼·博尔顿（Anthony Bolton）2010年推出的4.6亿英镑基金表现不佳的谜团。我之前故意向你们隐瞒了一个关键信息：博尔顿是在中国推出他的基金，而不是在英国。我不知道他在想什么，但既然他已在英国证明了自己的能力，我猜博尔顿是想要一个新的挑战。

但中国不是英国，尤其是在上市公司的行为和记录方面（顺便说一句，印度在这方面与中国并无太大不同）。你可能听说过瑞幸咖啡（Luckin Coffee），它曾号称要做中国的星巴克。它声称拥有比星巴克更具扩展性的模式，因为它销售廉价咖啡，主要供外带和外卖。它将自己定位为一家科技公司，因为顾客可以通过其APP下单。许多知名投资者，包括中国最大的风险投资公司之一愉悦资本（Joy Capital）和新加坡主权财富基金GIC，都曾以10亿美元的估值投资了瑞幸。

该公司于2019年5月在美国上市，到2020年1月，其股价已涨至50美元，公司估值超过120亿美元。2020年1月下旬，著名的做空机构浑水（Muddy Waters）发布了一份严厉的报告，指控瑞幸虚增销售额。更糟糕的是，瑞幸的审计机构安永（Ernst & Young）发现了其高级员工的欺诈行为。到2020年5月，该股已暴跌超过95%。

不幸的是，瑞幸并非个例。像艾瑞泰克（China Agritech）、中国绿色农业（China Green Agriculture）、中国综合能源（China Integrated Energy）、跟谁学（GSX Techedu）、爱奇艺（iQIYI）、龙威石油（Longwei Petroleum）、东方纸业（Orient Paper）、普大煤业（Puda Coal）和中电清洁能源（Sino Clean Energy）等中国公司都曾被指控存在会计违规或彻头彻尾的欺诈行为。

对于安东尼·博尔顿在中国失败的原因，“专家”们可能有无数种解释。我的解释是：博尔顿把中国的信号误认为是英国的信号。他没有意识到许多中国公司发出的信号从根本上就是不诚实的，他本应对其真实性持更强烈的怀疑态度。

在接受《南华早报》采访时，晨星分析师赵虎指出，博尔顿中国基金的投资组合公司中，不止一两家，而是三家都深陷会计丑闻和产品召回风波。博尔顿习惯了英国公司发出的诚实信号，但用赵虎的话说：“显然，他并没有为投资那些规模小、未经证实的中资公司而充分计入足够的风险折扣。”</div>

✳✳✳
There is almost never a clear winner in the arms race between the senders and receivers of signals in the natural world. You may have heard of cuckoos leaving their eggs in the nests of other bird species so that someone else can rear their chicks. The signals here are the size, shape, and color of the cuckoo egg, which match those of the eggs of some other bird species. However, scientists have found that some of the parasitized bird species have not allowed themselves to be exploited—they have evolved to produce eggs that are distinctly different, even compared to eggs of their own species.24 As a result, they recognize cuckoo eggs as interlopers. They have evolved a way to detect the dishonest signal from cuckoos. This race has no winner, and there will probably never be one.
In sharp contrast, in the business world, the senders of signals—the companies—are clearly winning over the receivers—us, the gullible investors. No wonder our community performs poorly compared to the broader market. What should we long-term investors do?
Ignore the green frog and heed the guppy.
Chapter Summary
Evolutionary theory has taught me that . . .
. . . reimagining investing requires us to differentiate between the honest and dishonest signals of businesses.
1. In nature, the “sender” of a signal attempts to influence the behavior of the “receiver.” For the receiver, differentiating between an honest and a dishonest signal can be the difference between life and death.
2. A green frog mimicking the low-pitched croak of its larger rival is a dishonest signal, whereas the conspicuous coloration of a male guppy is an honest indicator of its health and virility.
3. Zahavi’s handicap principle contends that a signal that is costly to produce is honest and can thus be relied upon by the receiver. The “cost” may be in the form of additional resources required to produce the signal or an increased risk of mortality.
4. As investors, we, too, are bombarded with signals, many of which are dishonest. Examples include press releases, management meetings and interviews, investor conferences, and earnings guidance. All these signals attempt to favorably impress investors and are generally quite easy to produce. We ignore all of them.
5. We rely exclusively on honest signals from businesses that, as in the natural world, are costly to produce. These include past operating and financial performance and scuttlebutt signals from suppliers, customers, competitors, ex-employees, and industry experts.
Section III
DON’T BE LAZY—BE VERY LAZY
If you have come this far, I hope you have been nodding your head in agreement more often than cursing the reviewers who persuaded you to buy or borrow this book. What’s not to like about avoiding significant risks and buying high-quality businesses? Of course, you and I can quibble about how much weight to give management meetings, whether 20 percent ROCE is acceptable, or at which stage of a turnaround one should invest. However, suppose you are a long-term investor or desire to be one. In that case, I am assuming we agree directionally—taking on avoidable risks is bad, and investing in great businesses is good.
Alas, our bonhomie may not last beyond this page.
When it comes to buying and selling businesses, we are not just lazy. We are very lazy. We rarely buy and seldom sell. Many—probably most—longterm investors ultimately sell their investments, especially when the price is egregious. We don’t. We are permanent owners. We will not sell a single share in a business we love. There are some minor caveats to this (which I will get to), but while some of you may accept the notion of buying rarely, the thought of never selling may seem wrong—even foolish—to you. That’s all right. My task in this book is not to tell you what you should do but to share what we do.
Chapters 8 and 9 invoke two relatively unknown tenets of evolutionary theory to bolster the case for buying rarely and selling even more rarely. Chapter 10 focuses on selling, or rather not selling, by elaborating on a well-known but underappreciated concept that unites evolution and long-term investing. Finally, I conclude the book by highlighting a key lesson for investors from evolutionary theory: A simple process can lead to a stellar outcome.
I end with rabbits and honeybees. But we must begin with birds and bears.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">好的，这是按照您的要求翻译的段落：

**黄蜂与兰花重述**
自然界信号发送者与接收者之间的军备竞赛，几乎从未有过明确的赢家。你可能听说过杜鹃将蛋产在其他鸟类的巢中，让其他鸟替其抚育幼雏。这里的信号是杜鹃蛋的大小、形状和颜色，它们与某些其他鸟类的蛋相匹配。然而，科学家发现，一些被寄生的鸟类并未任人宰割——它们进化出了明显不同的蛋，甚至与本物种的其他蛋相比也是如此。结果，它们能识别出杜鹃蛋是入侵者。它们进化出了识破杜鹃不诚实信号的方法。这场竞赛没有赢家，很可能永远也不会有。

与此形成鲜明对比的是，在商业世界中，信号的发送者——公司——显然正在战胜接收者——我们这些易受骗的投资者。难怪我们的投资表现远逊于整体市场。我们这些长期投资者该怎么办？

**无视绿蛙，关注孔雀鱼。**

**章节总结**
进化论教导我...
...重塑投资理念需要我们区分企业发出的诚实与不诚实信号。
1.  自然界中，信号的“发送者”试图影响“接收者”的行为。对接收者而言，区分诚实与不诚实信号可能关乎生死。
2.  一只模仿其体型更大对手低沉叫声的绿蛙发出的是不诚实信号，而雄性孔雀鱼鲜艳的体色则是其健康和活力的诚实指标。
3.  扎哈维的累赘原理认为，代价高昂的信号是诚实的，因此接收者可以信赖。这种“代价”可能体现在产生信号所需的额外资源，或是增加的死亡风险。
4.  作为投资者，我们也受到大量信号的轰炸，其中许多是不诚实的。例子包括新闻稿、管理层会议和访谈、投资者会议以及盈利指引。所有这些信号都试图给投资者留下好印象，并且通常很容易炮制。我们一概无视。
5.  我们完全依赖企业发出的诚实信号，如同自然界一样，这些信号的产生代价高昂。它们包括过去的经营和财务表现，以及来自供应商、客户、竞争对手、前雇员和行业专家的小道消息信号。

**第三部分**
**别只是懒惰——要非常懒惰**
如果你已经读到这里，我希望你更多是在点头赞同，而不是咒骂那些说服你购买或借阅本书的评论者。规避重大风险并买入优质企业，有什么理由不喜欢呢？当然，你我可以争论管理层会议该占多大权重、20%的资本回报率是否可接受，或者应该在扭亏为盈的哪个阶段投资。然而，假设你是一位长期投资者或渴望成为这样的人。那么，我认为我们在方向上是一致的——承担可避免的风险是坏事，投资于优秀的企业是好事。

唉，我们的融洽气氛可能无法延续到下一页了。
说到买卖企业，我们不仅懒惰。我们是非常懒惰。我们极少买入，更少卖出。许多——很可能是大多数——长期投资者最终会卖出他们的投资，尤其是在价格极其离谱时。我们不会。我们是永久所有者。我们不会卖出所钟爱企业的任何一股。这有一些小的例外（稍后我会谈到），但你们中的一些人或许能接受极少买入的理念，而永不卖出的想法可能让你觉得不对——甚至愚蠢。没关系。我在本书中的任务不是告诉你们该怎么做，而是分享我们的做法。

第八章和第九章援引进化论中两个相对鲜为人知的原则，来支撑“极少买入、更少卖出”的论点。第十章聚焦于卖出，或者更确切地说是不卖出，通过详细阐述一个将进化论与长期投资联系起来、广为人知但未被充分重视的概念。最后，我以强调进化论带给投资者的一个关键教训结束本书：简单的过程可以带来卓越的成果。

我以兔子和蜜蜂作结。但我们必须从鸟和熊开始。</div>
