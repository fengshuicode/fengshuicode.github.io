            <div class="text-block original-text">The Paradox of McKinsey and Sea Urchins
Moreover when a modification of structure has primarily arisen from the above or unknown causes, it may at first have been of no advantage to the species, but may subsequently have been taken advantage of by the descendants of the species under new conditions of life and with newly acquired habits.
Charles Darwin, On the Origin of Species, chapter 6, “Difficulties of the Theory”
We rarely use much debt and, when we do, we attempt to structure it on a long-term fixed basis. We will reject interesting opportunities rather than over-leverage our balance sheet. This conservatism has penalized our results but it is the only behavior that leaves us comfortable, considering our fiduciary obligations to policyholders, depositors, lenders and the many equity holders who have committed unusually large portions of their net worth to our care.
Warren Buffett, annual letter to shareholders, 1983
The world is shrunk into a few square miles of New York: the filth of Mumbai, the art of Berlin, the style of Paris, the food of London, the bustle of Tokyo, the gaudiness of Shanghai, the rudeness of Delhi, the shopping of Singapore, the decadence of Monaco, the chaos of Cairo, and the magnificence of its own. I love it. This is why we hold Nalanda’s annual investor meeting in the city every year in late June.
When my son was young (oh, why do they grow up?), he had two favorite spots in New York. Over time, they became mine, too: the Central Park Zoo and the FAO Schwarz toy store on Fifth Avenue. Our favorite activities there were petting the baby animals and dancing on the giant piano.
I remember FAO Schwarz less for its dazzling array of toys, many of which we bought over the years, and more for being soaked in wonder and amazement. There were magicians, Rubik’s Cube artists, giant cuddly pandas, other-worldly jugglers, and, on one occasion, a group of singers and dancers who rivaled Broadway performers. Growing up in semi-urban India, I had never been to a toy store before, and I am not sure to this day if our visits to this iconic institution were more exciting for my son or me.
After our ninth annual meeting in 2016, I remember walking up Fifth Avenue, waiting to be mesmerized by something new in the store. But it wasn’t there. A quick Google search on my phone sank my spirits. The store had shut permanently.
How in the world could this have happened? Why would the store be closed when it was almost always teeming with customers, and there never seemed to be enough cash registers?
The Mystery of McKinsey
McKinsey, the global strategy consulting firm, decided to enter India in 1992 following the beginning of the economic liberalization of the country in 1991.1 It decided to hire fresh interns from two MBA schools in the country. India did not have strategy consulting firms in 1992, and none of us knew anything about the industry. Remember that there was no internet then, so we could not even do basic research on the industry or the company. Our professors, too, were clueless.
I was a final year MBA student in one of those two schools. The Firm (as it is called by insiders), for some inexplicable reason, had decided to pay more than twice the next highest-paying company (Citibank). The entire MBA class applied, including me. No one cared what McKinsey did—the lure of the lucre was too strong to resist.
I happened to be at the right place at the right time (isn’t that life?) and was one of five MBA graduates hired. I was there for about six years. McKinsey is a great institution. Although life was quite tough—too many PowerPoint presentations and too many Air Miles—I enjoyed the competitive camaraderie, the satisfaction of working with CXOs, and its global oneness (I worked in four different international offices in six years). Having spent many years in the outside world after my departure from McKinsey, my admiration for the Firm has grown over the years as it has continued to dominate its industry.
McKinsey was founded in 1926 by James O. McKinsey, but the man who deserves the lion’s share of credit for building the Firm to its current glory is Marvin Bower, who joined in 1933. He transformed the small engineering and accounting firm into the management consulting powerhouse it is today.
In the ninety-plus years since McKinsey’s founding, the Firm has suffered cataclysmic internal and external shocks. Let’s start with some of the external shocks first: the Great Depression, the Second World War, rapid decolonization, the Cold War, the oil shock, multiple recessions in the United States and other major economies of the world, the population explosion, massive poverty reduction, the creation and destruction of conglomerates, the hollowing-out of manufacturing in the United States, the rise of China, the exponential increase in computing power and communications technology including the internet, the global financial crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic to name a few.
As the external world was undergoing rapid change, McKinsey itself worked through a few internal shocks: the transfer of power from Marvin Bower to the next generation in the late 1950s, repeated internal pressures for the firm to go public (including when I was there), the imprisonment of Anil Kumar and Rajat Gupta, its massive expansion into new geographies and industry segments over the years, its dubious fees arrangement with the South African utility Eskom, and the $600 million settlement for its work with the opioid manufacturer Purdue Pharma.
Not many of McKinsey’s competitors survived the rapid pace of change in the rough-and-tumble world of consulting—remember Monitor or Booz? On the other hand, McKinsey has not only survived but also continued to prosper doing exactly what it has always done: act as a trusted adviser to the CXOs. The Firm, at its core, has remained stubbornly immune to external and internal shocks.
But here is the funny—even weird—reality. The Firm, while remaining robust to change, has also changed dramatically over the past decades. It started in the United States but is now also in Cairo, Casablanca, and Chengdu; it primarily offered strategic consulting until the 1990s but has expanded into operational and technology consulting; it used to serve mostly manufacturers in its early days, but you will now find it crawling all over Google, Facebook, or a hot new start-up in the Valley; in my time, it rarely hired laterally, but according to friends who are now senior partners, the company now hires hundreds of experienced industry specialists.
Living Organisms Are Highly Robust
MBA degrees, management seminars, best-selling business books, and corporate titans all seem focused on ensuring that companies adapt to change and evolve into a better version of themselves. If one could bottle up corporate obsession, the label on this bottle would declare, “How do we change faster, better, and easier?”
I beg to differ. The question that should be on the minds of business leaders and investors is almost the exact opposite: How do we change without changing?
Let’s turn to evolutionary biology to understand why.
Biologists have always been aware of a strange conundrum of the living world. Organisms—animals, plants, algae, fungi, and even bacteria—are incredibly complex. But they are not delicate. On the contrary, they have survived and thrived for hundreds of millions of years—and in the case of bacteria, billions of years—despite continuous assault from the turbulent and dynamic external environment. Even their internal environments seem to be constantly revolting against them in the form of unceasing mutations.
Despite these external and internal perturbations, not only have living things survived, but they have also successfully diversified into millions of species. They occupy almost every available niche on our planet, from icy glaciers to boiling deep-sea thermal vents. One of the greatest wonders of this world is this: Living things are highly resistant to internal and external changes while simultaneously possessing the ability to evolve.2 Let me call this ability to function well despite internal and external disturbances “robustness.”
If the first proto-single-celled organism were too robust, it would have remained unchanged over 3.5 billion years, and we would not have had mushrooms or meerkats or Manhattan. On the other hand, if it were not robust enough, it would have gone extinct quite quickly in the volcanic and violent days of the early earth. You and I and all the living things we see around us are here because organic life has been able to strike a delicate balance between maintaining the status quo and evolving when the need arises. How does this happen, and what can we learn from it as investors?
This dual trick—of changing while remaining unchanged—results from two separate but intimately linked phenomena. First, living systems are robust at multiple levels. Second, this robustness helps neutral mutations become the source of future innovations.
What multiple levels? And what is a neutral mutation? Does this sound like gobbledygook? Let’s start at the start. Our mother, our creator. The DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) molecule.</div>

**麦肯锡与海胆的悖论**

此外，当结构上的改变最初源于上述或未知原因时，它起初可能对物种并无优势，但其后代在全新的生活条件和后天获得的习性下，可能会适应这种改变。
查尔斯·达尔文，《物种起源》，第六章“理论的难点”

我们很少大量使用债务，即使使用，也会尝试将其构建为长期固定模式。我们会放弃有趣的机会，也不愿过度举债。这种保守主义虽然影响了我们的业绩表现，但考虑到我们对保单持有人、存款人、贷款人以及众多将净资产中异常大比例交由我们管理的股东的受托义务，这是唯一让我们感到安心的做法。
沃伦·巴菲特，1983年致股东年度信函

世界仿佛浓缩在纽约的几平方英里之内：孟买的脏乱、柏林的艺术、巴黎的格调、伦敦的美食、东京的喧闹、上海的浮华、德里的粗鲁、新加坡的购物、摩纳哥的颓废、开罗的混乱，以及它自身的壮丽。我爱这座城市。这就是为什么我们每年六月底都在这里召开那烂陀（Nalanda）的投资者年会。

我儿子年幼时（唉，为什么孩子总是长得那么快呢？），他在纽约有两个最爱的地方。久而久之，它们也成了我的最爱：中央公园动物园和第五大道上的FAO Schwarz玩具店。我们在那里最喜欢的活动是抚摸小动物和在巨大的钢琴上跳舞。

我对FAO Schwarz的记忆，较少源于它令人眼花缭乱的玩具（多年来我们买过不少），更多是因为它浸润着惊奇与赞叹。那里有魔术师、魔方高手、巨大的毛绒熊猫、超凡脱俗的杂耍艺人，还有一次，我甚至看到一群堪比百老汇演员的歌手舞者。在印度半城市化地区长大的我，从未去过玩具店，时至今日，我仍不确定我们在这家标志性商店的时光，对我还是对我儿子来说更令人兴奋。

2016年第九次年会之后，我记得沿着第五大道走着，期待着被店里新奇的事物再次迷住。但它已经不在了。用手机快速搜索谷歌后，我心情低落。那家店永久关闭了。

这怎么可能发生？当店里几乎总是挤满顾客、收银台似乎永远不够用时，为什么还会关门？

**麦肯锡之谜**

1991年印度经济开始自由化后，全球战略咨询公司麦肯锡于1992年决定进入印度。它决定从印度的两所MBA学校招聘应届实习生。1992年印度没有战略咨询公司，我们中无人了解这个行业。请记住当时没有互联网，我们甚至无法对这个行业或公司进行基本的研究。我们的教授也同样一无所知。

我当时是其中一所学校的MBA应届毕业生。这家公司（内部人士如此称呼它），出于某种难以解释的原因，决定提供比当时薪资第二高的公司（花旗银行）高出两倍多的薪水。整个MBA班级都申请了，包括我。没人关心麦肯锡做什么——金钱的诱惑实在难以抗拒。

我碰巧在正确的时间出现在正确的地方（人生不就是这样吗？），成为被录用的五名MBA毕业生之一。我在那里工作了大约六年。麦肯锡是一家伟大的机构。虽然工作相当辛苦——太多的PPT演示和太多的飞行里程——但我享受那种充满竞争的同事情谊、与高管（CXO）共事的满足感以及它的全球一体性（六年里我在四个不同的国际办公室工作过）。离开麦肯锡多年后，在外部世界摸爬滚打多年，我对这家公司的钦佩与日俱增，因为它持续主导着其所在的行业。

麦肯锡由詹姆斯·O·麦肯锡于1926年创立，但为将公司建设到如今辉煌而功劳最大的人是1933年加入的马文·鲍尔。他将这家小型工程和会计师事务所转变为今天的管理咨询巨头。

在麦肯锡创立至今的九十多年里，公司经历了剧烈的内外部冲击。让我们先看一些外部冲击：大萧条、第二次世界大战、快速的非殖民化、冷战、石油危机、美国及世界其他主要经济体的多次衰退、人口爆炸、大规模减贫、企业集团的兴衰、美国制造业的空心化、中国的崛起、计算能力和通信技术（包括互联网）的指数级增长、全球金融危机以及COVID-19大流行等等。

在外部世界经历剧变的同时，麦肯锡自身也经历了一些内部冲击：1950年代末马文·鲍尔向下一代的权力交接、公司内部反复出现的上市压力（包括我在职期间）、阿尼尔·库马尔和拉贾特·古普塔的入狱事件、多年来向新地域和行业板块的大规模扩张、与南非公用事业公司Eskom有争议的收费安排，以及因其与阿片类药物制造商普渡制药（Purdue Pharma）的合作而支付的6亿美元和解金。

在咨询界竞争激烈的世界中，很少有麦肯锡的竞争对手能在快速变化中存活下来——还记得Monitor或Booz吗？另一方面，麦肯锡不仅存活了下来，而且持续繁荣，做的正是它一直做的事：充当高管们值得信赖的顾问。这家公司的核心，顽固地对内外部冲击保持着免疫力。

但这里有一个有趣——甚至怪异——的现实。这家公司，在保持对变革的强大适应力的同时，也在过去几十年里发生了巨大的变化。它始于美国，但如今也开到了开罗、卡萨布兰卡和成都；它在1990年代之前主要提供战略咨询，但已扩展到运营和技术咨询；早期主要服务于制造商，但现在你会发现它遍布谷歌、脸书或硅谷炙手可热的新创公司；在我那个时代，它很少从外部引进人才，但据现在已是资深合伙人的朋友说，公司现在雇佣了数百名经验丰富的行业专家。

**生命体具有高度稳健性**

MBA学位、管理研讨会、畅销商业书籍和企业巨头们似乎都专注于确保公司适应变化，并进化成更好的版本。如果能将企业的执念装瓶，瓶身上的标签会写着：“我们如何更快、更好、更容易地改变？”

我持不同意见。商业领袖和投资者应该思考的问题几乎恰恰相反：我们如何做到改变而不变？

让我们转向进化生物学来理解其中的原因。

生物学家们一直意识到生命世界的一个奇怪难题。生物体——动物、植物、藻类、真菌，甚至细菌——都极其复杂。但它们并不脆弱。相反，尽管持续遭受动荡多变的外部环境的冲击，它们已生存并繁衍了数亿年——就细菌而言，更是数十亿年。即使它们的内部环境也似乎通过不断的突变形式持续进行着“反抗”。

尽管存在这些内外部扰动，生物不仅生存了下来，还成功地分化成数百万个物种。它们占据了地球上几乎每一个可用的生态位，从冰冷的冰川到沸腾的深海热泉口。这个世界最伟大的奇迹之一就是：生物体对内外变化具有高度的抵抗力，同时拥有进化的能力。让我将这种在内外干扰下仍能良好运作的能力称为“稳健性”。

如果第一个原始单细胞生物过于稳健，它会在35亿年间保持不变，我们就不会有蘑菇、猫鼬或曼哈顿。另一方面，如果它不够稳健，在早期地球火山活动剧烈、环境恶劣的日子里，它很快就会灭绝。你、我以及我们周围看到的所有生物之所以存在，是因为有机生命能够在维持现状与在需要时进化之间取得微妙的平衡。这是如何发生的？作为投资者，我们能从中学习到什么？

这种“变而不变”的双重技巧源于两个独立但又紧密联系的现象。首先，生命系统在多个层面上具有稳健性。其次，这种稳健性有助于中性突变成为未来创新的源泉。

哪些层面？什么是中性突变？这听起来像天书吗？让我们从头开始。我们的母亲，我们的创造者。DNA（脱氧核糖核酸）分子。

            <div class="text-block original-text">The DNA molecule in any organism—be it a plant or a human being—serves two key functions. It carries information to build the body parts of an organism (for example, skin, kidney, petals, leaves) and is transmitted to offspring. DNA-based genetic code determines who we are and what our children will be. The DNA molecule is shaped in the form of a double helix and consists of four types of units called nucleotides: A (adenosine), C (cytosine), G (guanine), and T (thymine). As shown at the top of figure 3.1, a gene comprises a chain of nucleotides that can number from a few hundred to a couple of million! I have shown nine nucleotides here for illustration. These DNA nucleotides always exist in pairs called base pairs. The T nucleotide always pairs with A, and the C nucleotide always pairs with G. Figure 3.1 shows just one-half of a base pair with the sequence ACGGATCGA.
3.1 DNA makes mRNA makes protein.
The DNA of all organisms comprises the same four nucleotides (A, C, G, and T). Just think about it for a moment: Orchids and orangutans share these same four nucleotides in their DNA code; they are just arranged differently in each. Human beings have three billion base pairs of nucleotides. Not in our whole body. In almost every cell of our body. I find this quite astounding. Remember that the next time you are packing a tight suitcase! And just because we rule the world does not mean we have the largest genome. The size of the human genome is quite unremarkable. The lowly Amoeba dubia, a single-celled organism, has 670 billion base pairs in its DNA—that makes for a genome about 220 times larger than yours and mine.3
For this discussion, let’s focus just on genes that manufacture proteins. We are all essentially a bag of proteins. Proteins build bodies and regulate, defend, and monitor their functioning. Our body parts differ because they have different proteins. For instance, keratin makes our skin, hemoglobin carries oxygen in our blood, and proteins called immunoglobulins defend us from parasites.
DNA makes protein in a two-step process: the first being transcription and the second translation.4 First, a single strand of DNA with a long chain of A, C, T, and G nucleotides gets transcribed onto a complementary messenger RNA (ribonucleic acid) sequence called mRNA (yes, this molecule is the basis of the COVID-19 vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna). Thus, the DNA sequence ACGGATCGA shown in figure 3.1 will get transcribed to the mRNA sequence UGCCUAGCU. What is this new letter, U? In the transcription process, the DNA nucleotide A (adenosine) gets transcribed onto the mRNA nucleotide U (uracil), and, as described earlier, C pairs with G and T with A.
A DNA sequence has produced a corresponding mRNA sequence. What now? In the second step, a sequence of mRNA molecules is translated into a sequence of amino acids that synthesize a protein. mRNA is a single-stranded molecule, and it comprises codons made of three nucleotides that code for specific amino acids. In the mRNA sequence UGCCUAGCU shown in figure 3.1, the first codon, UGC, makes the amino acid tyrosine; the second codon, CUA, codes for leucine, and the third codon, GCU, codes for the amino acid alanine. A sequence of amino acids folds into a protein. Voilà! DNA made mRNA, which then made a protein.
If you are a biologist, I hope you haven’t had a heart attack—I know that these few lines don’t fully capture the complexities and nuances of the working of the universal genetic code. We haven’t covered rRNA, tRNA, noncoding DNA, or enzymes. But hey, this is not a biology textbook, and I am simply trying to lay the basic groundwork to make sure we all have the same basic understanding of genetic code before moving ahead.
To comprehend the robustness of living organisms at multiple levels, let’s start at the bottom: the universal genetic code.
The Genetic Code Is Robust
As mentioned, a codon comprising three bases creates an amino acid. Thus, the codon AGC creates the amino acid serine, and GGC makes glycine. Since any of the four nucleotides (A, C, U, or G) can occupy one of the three bases, there are sixty-four possible amino acids (4 × 4 × 4). However, only twenty exist in nature. How so? This is because two or more codons can code for the same amino acid. For instance, GGU, GGC, GGA, and GGG are all glycine. Thus, any mutation on the third position of the codon with the first two positions GG will always form glycine. These are called synonymous mutations. The formation of glycine is thus highly robust to mutations on the third base. Overall, the universal genetic code has funneled down sixty-four possibilities to just twenty through this type of synonymous mutation.5
Synonymous mutations are just the first level of robustness. Scientists have found that translation errors—errors at the point of codon formation—are most likely at the third position and least likely at the first position. Amazingly, the degree of robustness is also highest at the third position of the codon,6 as in the earlier example of glycine. Thus, even though the third position is most error prone in translation, it will have no impact on the type of amino acid formed! In other words, evolution has ensured that the genetic code is extremely robust to mutations and translation errors. Isn’t that cool?
Proteins Are Robust
Let’s now go one level beyond the genetic code to see if proteins are robust to changes in the sequence of amino acids.
As discussed, a protein is a large molecule made up of a certain amino acid sequence. They are in all living organisms and are directly involved in all the chemical processes essential for creating and sustaining life. Thus, given the stability of life forms, one would expect proteins to show a high degree of robustness, and that is exactly what we see.
There are three types of protein robustness. First, scientists have found that the function of proteins is unaffected by the vast majority of amino acid changes. For example, the bacteria E. coli carries a protein called β-lactamase, which confers antibiotic resistance. This protein has 263 amino acids, 84 percent of which can experience mutation (i.e., they can be changed into another amino acid) without changing the enzyme’s basic function. Ponder that. It would be like making 84 mistakes on a math exam comprising 100 questions and still getting an A!
The second type of robustness results from proteins with similar functions and structures being able to be made from different amino acid sequences. For example, myoglobin and hemoglobin are oxygen-binding proteins in vertebrates, and they have many distant relatives in invertebrates (like crabs and spiders) and plants. The three-dimensional structure of whale myoglobin and clam hemoglobin can be almost perfectly superimposed! Despite this uncanny structural and functional similarity, the amino acid sequences of the two are very different. Only 18 percent of the amino acids of the whale myoglobin and clam hemoglobin overlap.
Third, scientists have found that the vast majority of amino acid sequences fold into very few structures. No, I really mean it—very few. Let’s see how few. A small protein may have 100 amino acids, and so the number of possible protein folds is 20100, which is more than the number of atoms in the universe.7 And how many proteins exist? About 10,000 (or 203). Thus, protein structure and function are extremely robust.
The Body Is Robust
Let’s now go one level up from proteins to the body by taking the example of sea urchins.
Sea urchins evolved 250 million years ago and comprise about 1,000 species. For now, we will focus on just two found in shallow waters in Australia: Heliocidaris tuberculata and Heliocidaris erythrogramma. Let’s call them species T and E. Their body plans are conserved; in other words, they look the same but have dramatically different modes of development.
T produces larvae (called pluteus) that bear no physical resemblance to the adult, and these free-swimming pluteus feed on plankton as they grow into adulthood. E, on the other hand, develops directly from an egg with no larval stage in between. But T and E are quite closely related and diverged only about five million years ago (almost the same time that chimpanzees and humans diverged; it would be as if chimps produced larvae that did not look like adult chimps!). The entire development programs—the shape and size of eggs, the location of cell formation for various body parts, the activation of genes that control development—of these two species differ so significantly that it is almost unbelievable that the two species have a common ancestor from only five million years ago. Despite these massive developmental changes, if you do a Google search for images of T and E, you will notice that they look almost the same.
How have the sea urchins maintained their body plans while changing many fundamental aspects of their development? And what have they achieved by maintaining highly robust body plans while evolving drastically different routes of development? We will get to these questions in a moment, but for now, let me summarize what we have learned.
We have seen that the stability of living organisms and species is maintained through robustness at multiple levels: at the levels of genetic code, proteins, and even body plan. For the sake of brevity, I have chosen to omit details of robustness at many other levels: changes in the secondary structure of RNA, changes in the regulatory regions of a gene, and drastic changes in enzyme activity, just to name a few.
A mutation changes the DNA sequence of a gene? No problem. It produces the same amino acid. The amino acid sequence changes owing to mutation or recombination? No problem. It produces the same protein. There is a change in the arrangement of proteins? No problem. The same enzyme activity continues. And so on. Living things are built to be resilient and resistant to change.</div>

任何生物体中的DNA分子——无论是植物还是人类——都具备两个关键功能：携带构建生物体部件（如皮肤、肾脏、花瓣、叶片）的信息，并将这些信息传递给后代。基于DNA的遗传密码决定了我们自身的特征以及后代将继承的特征。DNA分子呈双螺旋结构，由四种称为核苷酸的基本单位构成：A（腺嘌呤）、C（胞嘧啶）、G（鸟嘌呤）和T（胸腺嘧啶）。基因由数百至数百万个核苷酸链组成，图中展示了由九个核苷酸构成的示例。这些DNA核苷酸始终以碱基对形式存在：T总是与A配对，C总是与G配对。

所有生物的DNA都由相同的四种核苷酸（A、C、G、T）组成。试想：兰花和红毛猩猩的DNA编码共享这四种核苷酸，仅排列方式不同。人类拥有三十亿个碱基对——这存在于身体的几乎每个细胞中。然而人类基因组规模并不突出，单细胞生物变形虫的DNA就含有六千七百亿个碱基对。

我们重点讨论制造蛋白质的基因。生命体本质上是蛋白质的集合体，蛋白质构建躯体并调控、防御、监测机体功能。身体各部位因所含蛋白质不同而产生差异，例如构成皮肤的角蛋白、血液中运输氧的血红蛋白、抵御寄生虫的免疫球蛋白。

DNA通过转录和翻译两个步骤制造蛋白质。首先，携带A、C、T、G核苷酸长链的DNA单链转录为互补的信使RNA（mRNA）。在此过程中，DNA的A转录为mRNA的U（尿嘧啶），C与G配对，T与A配对。随后mRNA序列被翻译成氨基酸序列以合成蛋白质。mRNA是包含密码子的单链分子，每个密码子由三个核苷酸构成，对应特定氨基酸。氨基酸序列最终折叠形成蛋白质——DNA通过mRNA制造出蛋白质。

遗传密码具有强健性
由三个碱基组成的密码子对应一种氨基酸。四种核苷酸（A、C、U、G）在三个位置上的排列组合可产生六十四种可能，但自然界仅有二十种氨基酸存在。这是因为多个密码子可编码同种氨基酸。例如GGU、GGC、GGA、GGG都对应甘氨酸。当密码子前两位为GG时，第三位的任何突变始终产生甘氨酸，这类同义突变使遗传系统对第三位碱基突变具有高度强健性。整体上，通用遗传密码通过同义突变将六十四种可能缩减至二十种。

科学家发现翻译错误最易出现在密码子第三位，而强健性恰恰在该位点表现最强。因此尽管第三位最易出错，却不会影响最终生成的氨基酸类型——进化确保了遗传密码对突变和翻译错误的极端强健性。

蛋白质具有强健性
蛋白质作为由特定氨基酸序列构成的大分子，表现出三类强健性：
1. 绝大多数氨基酸替换不影响蛋白质功能。如大肠杆菌的β-内酰胺酶含263个氨基酸，其中84%发生突变仍不改变基本功能。
2. 相似结构和功能的蛋白质可由不同氨基酸序列形成。如脊椎动物的肌红蛋白与血红蛋白，同无脊椎动物（蟹、蛛）及植物的同源蛋白虽氨基酸序列差异显著（鲸肌红蛋白与蛤血红蛋白仅18%相同），三维结构却高度吻合。
3. 绝大多数氨基酸序列仅折叠为极少数结构。含100个氨基酸的小型蛋白可能存在超过宇宙原子总数的折叠方式（20¹⁰⁰），而实际仅存在约万种蛋白质（20³）。

生命体具有强健性
以海胆为例：澳洲浅海的结节海胆（T）和红斑海胆（E）形态相似但发育模式迥异。T经历与成体形态迥异的浮游幼体期，E则直接由卵发育。尽管二者共享五百万年前的共同祖先（分化时间与黑猩猩和人类相当），其发育程序（卵形态、细胞定位、基因激活）差异巨大，却仍维持相同体型结构。

生命体通过多层次的强健性维持稳定：基因突变产生相同氨基酸→氨基酸序列改变形成相同蛋白质→蛋白质排布变化维持相同酶活性。生物天生具备抵御变化的强健特性。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">The Evolution of Evolvability
This gets us to the paradox I mentioned at the start of the chapter. Given multiple levels of robustness, how in the world do species evolve? Should they not stay fixed? What propelled bacteria to become bonobos?
The short and incredible answer is that robustness itself leads to evolvability!
We need to make a brief foray into one aspect of the history of molecular biology to unravel the paradox. In 1968, the Japanese geneticist Motoo Kimura proposed the “neutral theory” of molecular evolution.8 Kimura contended that most changes at the level of DNA and amino acids do not impact the function of a molecule and hence the organism’s ability to survive and reproduce. He contended that a small number of mutations are favorable, and natural selection preserves them. Some mutations are rejected because they are harmful, but most mutations don’t really affect the organism. According to Kimura, most mutations are neutral, which causes robustness in the organism.
So how does neutral mutation lead to evolution? While a neutral change does not alter the primary function, it can alter a secondary function, thereby becoming the source of a future innovation.
Let’s say gene A has primary function F. Owing to a mutation, gene A becomes gene B, but since it’s a robust system, gene B continues to perform function F. But gene B affects a secondary function, FS. FS does not alter the fitness of the organism but can be used by the organism’s descendants for a completely new function, thereby leading to evolution. Thus, although the genetic code was robust (because gene A changing into gene B did not affect function F), the addition of function FS allowed the organism to evolve.
In a robust biological system, evolvability comes free!
Let’s now return to the sea urchin example. T and E have maintained their body plans’ robustness while changing their development cycle through neutral mutations over millions of years. For example, 16 of the 32 cells of the T embryo become the ectoderm (the outer layer of skin), whereas 26 of the 32 E embryo cells do so. The sea urchins’ body structures have stayed robust to multiple changes in embryonic development. As a result, they have exploited a completely new ecological niche and a novel way of life. For example, E is abundant in deep seas and polar latitudes where T cannot survive—this is because E develops directly and does not need to go through the larval stage critically dependent on plankton for survival.
Something similar has been happening at McKinsey over the past century. Today’s McKinsey bears no resemblance to Marvin Bower’s McKinsey in terms of geographical presence, organization processes, type of client work, and breadth of expertise. But at some fundamental level of culture, oneness, problem-solving, and working with CXOs, the firm has remained stubbornly Boweresque. It has changed without changing. This is what we seek as owners in our businesses: the ability to keep evolving while staying robust.
Businesses Must Be Robust to Evolve
Let’s recap our journey until now. We have eliminated serious risks (chapter 1) and have shortlisted businesses based on ROCE (chapter 2). Now we need to select companies for their robustness.
Here are some learnings we have internalized at Nalanda.
Robustness Takes Many Forms
How does an investor measure robustness in a business? I wish I had a simple quantitative answer. I don’t. Like almost everything in investing, the solution is somewhat subjective, somewhat vague, and somewhat controversial. But it works for us. The best way to understand robustness is to contrast the two extremes listed in table 3.1.
Table 3.1Examples of robustness in a business
Most robust
Least robust
Has delivered high historical ROCE over a long period
Has made operating losses for most or all of its history
Has a fragmented customer base
Is dependent on very few customers
Has no debt and has excess cash
Is highly leveraged
Has built high competitive barriers
Has been unable to keep competition away
Has a fragmented supplier base
Is dependent on a few suppliers
Has a stable management team
Management turnover is high
Industry is slow changing
Industry is evolving fast
This is not an exhaustive list, but I hope you will get the general drift of what I mean when I say a business is robust. A robust business lies on a continuum between the two “poles” described in the table, with a bias toward the left side.
You will notice that, unlike in chapter 2, where we used the quantitative criterion of ROCE to select businesses, many factors contributing to robustness are qualitative. Also, almost no business falls entirely within the left or right column in my experience. Robustness is not a black-and-white measure. Thankfully. Or else, what would separate a good investor from a great one?
Different investors attribute different weights to the factors listed in table 3.1. For instance, many investors do not consider customer concentration to be a problem for a business. We do. We took advantage of these contrasting opinions a few months after the inception of Nalanda.
WNS is an Indian business process outsourcing (BPO) company with a U.S. listing. The leading BPO companies like WNS provide many mission-critical services to their clients of a quality and at a price that can typically not be matched by the company’s internal teams. For example, they help their clients close the books of accounts, manage payables and receivables, perform timely consumer analytics, process mortgage applications, and address customer issues. We had been tracking WNS since we started Nalanda in 2007. Despite its high ROCE, zero debt, strong competitive advantage, and stable management team, we did not like the business because of its dependence on just a few customers. In 2006, WNS’s top five customers accounted for 41 percent of revenue, and in 2007, this number had jumped to 55 percent.9 We worried that the company’s robustness was low and declining. But the markets did not seem to care, and WNS’s stock price reached $35 by the middle of 2007.
WNS lost a major client in the latter half of 2007, and another client threatened to terminate their agreement. This wasn’t great news in the short term, and the markets punished WNS severely. The stock crashed to $13 in early 2008. However, we concluded that the company would become more robust with a more fragmented customer base. We bought about 6 percent of the business from January to March 2008. Fast-forward thirteen years, and in 2020, WNS’s top five clients accounted for only 25 percent of revenue. What was supposedly lousy news in 2007 looked pretty good in 2020!
We Assess Evolvability Indirectly by Measuring Robustness Directly
As permanent owners, we Nalanda folks are hungry for companies that can successfully implement neutral strategies to evolve and adapt to a changing environment. We want evolvability. Correction. We need evolvability. Having invested, we need the business to survive the onslaught of AI or other technologies, to upstage its increasing online and offline competition, to withstand multiple recessions, to conquer the adverse effects of climate change, to survive management turnover, and much more. We need it to be able to adapt.
However, just as evolutionary biologists struggle to measure evolvability,10 I haven’t yet figured out a reliable way in advance to directly assess a company’s propensity to adapt to a changing world. Many investors contend that management interviews and discussions are an excellent way to assess the future adaptability of a business. Maybe. I consider such interviews a waste of time—but more on that later (in chapter 7).
But there is an indirect—and I would argue a reasonably reliable—path of satisfying my need. It is by measuring the robustness of an organization. Robustness lays the groundwork for evolution in living things. It does the same in businesses. Robustness is a necessary—though not sufficient—requirement for businesses to evolve successfully.
In a robust business, just as in a living organism, evolvability comes free.
Take the example of two businesses in an industry. Company A is the leader, and on sales of $100, it earns a margin of 20 percent. Let’s assume its capital employed (in fixed assets, receivables, and inventory) is $50. Company A’s ROCE is quite healthy at 40 percent (100 × 20% ÷ 50). If a company’s growth is lower than its ROCE, it will also keep generating free cash flow, and so Company A has no debt. Company B is a weak player in the industry with half the sales of Company A, $50, and a margin of 15 percent. Since it does not have enough bargaining power with suppliers (who demand early payment) or customers (who pay late), its capital employed is the same as that of Company A ($50). Company B’s ROCE is 15 percent (50 × 15% ÷ 50). Company B has a debt of $10 (which is not much, given its operating profit of $7.50), and its cost of debt is 5 percent.
Thus, both are earning decent ROCE and have a reasonably strong balance sheet—Company A is better, but Company B isn’t too bad.
All seems fine. Until it’s not.
COVID-19 strikes, and the country goes into a lockdown. Sales at both companies fall by half, and so do the operating margins. Company A, being a leader, can collect cash and liquidate inventory so that its capital employed falls to $25. Company B, on the other hand, while suffering the same drop in sales and margins as Company A, is rebuffed by its customers while asking for money and is also unable to sell its finished goods in a demand-poor environment. Its capital employed stays flat at $50. Company A’s ROCE is now 20 percent (50 × 10% ÷ 25), and Company B’s is 4 percent (25 × 7.5% ÷ 50).</div>

**可进化性的演变**
这就引出了本章开头提到的悖论：既然存在多层次的稳健性，物种究竟如何进化？它们不该保持固定吗？是什么推动细菌变成了倭黑猩猩？

简短而惊人的答案是：稳健性本身催生了可进化性！

要解开这个悖论，我们需要简要回顾分子生物学的历史片段。1968年，日本遗传学家木村资生提出分子进化的"中性理论"。木村认为，DNA和氨基酸层面的大多数变化不会影响分子功能，因此也不会影响生物体的生存繁殖能力。他指出少数突变具有优势，自然选择会保留这些突变；部分有害突变会被淘汰，但大多数突变对生物体实际没有影响。在木村看来，中性突变造就了生物体的稳健性。

中性突变如何推动进化？中性变化虽不改变主要功能，却能改变次要功能，从而成为未来创新的源泉。

假设基因A具备主要功能F。突变使基因A变为基因B，由于系统稳健，基因B仍能执行功能F。但基因B影响了次要功能FS。FS虽不改变生物体的适应度，却可能被后代用于全新功能，进而引发进化。因此，尽管遗传密码具有稳健性（基因A变为B未影响功能F），但FS功能的增加使生物体得以进化。

在稳健的生物系统中，可进化性不费吹灰之力即可获得！

现在回到海胆案例。T种和E种海胆在数百万年间通过中性突变改变发育周期，同时保持着身体构造的稳健性。例如T种胚胎的32个细胞中有16个发育成外胚层（皮肤外层），而E种胚胎32个细胞中有26个实现此功能。海胆的身体结构在胚胎发育的多次变化中始终保持稳健，因此它们开拓了全新生态位和生存方式。例如E种在深海和极地大量繁殖——这些T种无法生存的区域，正是因为E种直接发育，无需经历依赖浮游生物的幼体阶段。

麦肯锡公司在过去百年也发生着类似演变。如今麦肯锡在地域分布、组织流程、客户类型和专业知识广度上，与马文·鲍尔时代已截然不同。但在文化内核、凝聚力、问题解决及高管协作等根本层面，公司依然保持着鲍尔式的特质。它在变革中坚守本质。这正是企业所有者追求的境界：在保持稳健的同时持续进化。

**企业须稳健方能进化**
现在回顾我们的探索路径：第一章消除重大风险，第二章依据资本使用回报率（ROCE）筛选企业，接下来要基于稳健性选择公司。

以下是我们在那澜陀内部总结的认知：

**稳健性的多元形态**
投资者如何衡量企业稳健性？很遗憾我无法给出简单量化答案。与投资领域多数情况类似，解决方案兼具主观性、模糊性和争议性——但对我们行之有效。理解稳健性最佳方式是对比下表呈现的两个极端形态：

表3.1 企业稳健性示例
（注：根据要求省略表格具体内容，仅保留论述性文本）

此表虽未穷尽所有要素，但能帮助理解企业稳健性的核心内涵。稳健企业处于表中两极之间的连续谱系，且偏向左侧。

你会注意到：与第二章使用量化指标ROCE不同，构成稳健性的要素多为定性指标。实践中几乎没有企业完全符合左栏或右栏特征——稳健性并非非黑即白的标尺。所幸如此，否则卓越投资者与普通投资者如何区分？

不同投资者对表3.1要素赋予不同权重。例如很多投资者不认为客户集中是问题，但我们持相反观点。那澜陀创立数月后，我们便利用了这种认知差异。

WNS是在美上市的印度业务流程外包（BPO）企业。这类领先BPO公司以内部团队难以企及的质量和价格，为客户提供关键服务：协助结账、管理应付应收、实时消费者分析、按揭申请处理和客诉响应等。自2007年那澜陀创立起我们就关注WNS。尽管其ROCE高企、零负债、竞争优势突出且管理团队稳定，我们仍因其客户集中度放弃投资——2006年前五大客户占营收41%，2007年飙升至55%。我们担忧其稳健性薄弱且持续恶化，但市场漠视此风险，2007年中WNS股价达35美元。

2007年下半年WNS丢失大客户，另一客户威胁终止合作。短期利空导致股价在2008年初暴跌至13美元。但我们判断客户结构分散化将提升公司稳健性，遂于2008年1-3月购入约6%股权。十三年后的2020年，WNS前五大客户营收占比仅25%——曾经的利空反成利好！

**通过测量稳健性间接评估可进化性**
作为长期所有者，我们渴求那些能实施中性策略以适应环境变化的企业。我们不仅想要、更需要可进化性。投资后，企业必须经受AI冲击、线上线下竞争、多次衰退、气候变化及管理层更迭等考验——我们需要其具备适应力。

然而正如进化生物学家难以量化可进化性，我也尚未找到直接评估企业适应力的可靠方法。许多投资者主张通过管理层访谈判断企业未来适应性，但我认为这类访谈徒耗时间（第七章将详述）。

不过存在一条间接却可靠的评估路径：测量组织稳健性。稳健性为生物进化奠基，对企业亦然。它是企业成功进化的必要条件（虽非充分条件）。

正如生物体那般，稳健企业的可进化性浑然天成。

以同行业两家企业为例：领军企业A销售额100美元，利润率20%，资本投入（固定资产+应收款+存货）50美元，ROCE达40%（100×20%÷50）。当增速低于ROCE时，企业持续产生自由现金流，故A公司零负债。弱势企业B销售额50美元，利润率15%，因对供应商（要求预付款）和客户（延迟付款）议价能力弱，资本投入同为50美元，ROCE仅15%（50×15%÷50）。B公司负债10美元（相对于7.5美元营业利润尚可承受），债务成本5%。

表面看两家企业ROCE尚可，资产负债表均较健康——A公司更优，B公司亦不差。

但危机骤现：新冠疫情导致封城。两家公司销售额与利润率均腰斩。领军企业A能回笼现金、清减库存，使资本投入降至25美元；而同等受损的B公司催收货款遭拒，需求萎靡下产成品滞销，资本投入维持50美元。此时A公司ROCE为20%（50×10%÷25），B公司则降至4%（25×7.5%÷50）。</div>

        <div class="content-row">
            <span class="paragraph-number">4.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">Thus, even during the pandemic, Company A earns a respectable ROCE, allowing it to invest in growth. Fortified by its ROCE of 20 percent, Company A can also borrow in the market if it needs to, since the cost of debt is just 5 percent and the company is debt free. From being comfortably mediocre during the pre-pandemic era, Company B risks oblivion because it no longer has the money to invest in production, marketing, and distribution. At 4 percent ROCE, it would struggle to pay its debt at 5 percent. Given its precarious balance sheet and declining profits, lenders would also hesitate to lend it more money.
At least in the near term, a likely outcome is that Company A gains market share and Company B further loses its position. Since Company A had a higher degree of robustness owing to its high ROCE, it could adapt and evolve in an adverse external environment.
What I have outlined is not a theoretical construct. We have seen this story play out in many of our businesses. When the pandemic began, the general opinion was that all Indian businesses would suffer. Sharp stock market declines in March and April 2020 mirrored this opinion. However, as the months passed, the differences in the impact on the business of companies with differential degrees of robustness became quite stark. During and after the COVID crisis, we have seen these divergent outcomes play out across many of our companies and industries, be it paint, innerwear, air conditioners, tires, pipes, or batteries.
One of the best-run companies in our portfolio is Page Industries, which we were very fortunate to buy a few days after the collapse of Lehman in late 2008. Page is the exclusive licensee for the Jockey brand in India and is the largest seller of innerwear in the country.11 Page aggressively launched new products during the pandemic and opened new stores while many of its competitors either vanished or were significantly weakened.
There are four listed innerwear companies in India, the other three being Maxwell, Rupa, and Lovable. Page’s market share among its listed peers in December 2018 was already relatively high at 66 percent. However, by December 2020, Page’s market share had grown to 70 percent. We don’t have data for the dozens of unlisted companies, but from anecdotal evidence and feedback from industry insiders, it appears that Page’s market share gain over this group during the pandemic has been even greater.
I believe Page’s robustness was a significant—if not the primary or only—reason for its continued success during the crisis. Let’s see how Page scores on the various factors contributing to robustness listed in table 3.1. For the year ended March 2020, Page’s ROCE was 63 percent, and it was debt free. It has highly fragmented customer and supplier bases. In my opinion, it has built a deep and wide moat by investing in brand and distribution over twenty-five years. It has had the same owner since 1995. Its industry is changing very slowly, with the top players remaining the same for more than a decade.
The greater the robustness, the greater the evolvability.
We Demand Multiple Levels of Robustness in Our Businesses
There is an unbroken chain of life between us and our last universal common ancestor (scientists call it LUCA) 3.5 billion years ago.12 Every part of this unbroken and evolving lineage has had robustness at multiple levels: genes, proteins, and body plan, to name just three. In a not dissimilar manner, I have discovered over more than two decades of investing that more levels of robustness lead to more evolvability.
Let’s revisit table 3.1, which lists seven factors of robustness. As I have mentioned, there are more factors one can conjure (for example, propensity for M&A, governance), but let’s stick with these seven for now. My aim is to point you in a certain direction, not to spoon-feed.
We want our companies to tilt toward the left side of table 3.1 across all factors. Thus, we want the business to be robust at the level of ROCE and concentration of customer base and degree of leverage and strength of competitive advantage, and so on.
Is this asking for a lot? You bet. We are permanent owners—the key word here being “permanent.” If a business can’t last permanently, we don’t want to own it. Without several levels of robustness, how will we be sure that the business will survive over the long term? I wish I could categorically answer the question, Is this a robust business? As a practicing investor, I know that assessing robustness is a matter of judgment and that there is no shortcut to this process. I have arrived at a certain heuristic after many years of investing. There clearly are black-and-white extremes to robustness (e.g., a business with just two customers) but in many, maybe even most, businesses, it is the gray zone that stares at us.
For example, is a company with a debt/equity ratio of 2.0 robust? Probably not. What about a ratio of 0.2 or 0.5? Maybe. For me, the answer depends on the other factors of robustness. Almost all the companies in our portfolio are debt free. Still, in 2010 we invested in India’s leading plastic pipes business (used in homes and agriculture), Supreme Industries, whose debt/EBITDA ratio was 0.6. Not high, but not zero either. Despite the company having debt—which was small to begin with—we concluded that the company was robust because it was the clear industry leader, had been gaining market share over its competitors, had a return on capital of more than 30 percent, had successfully designed and launched many products over the past decade, had thousands of distribution points across India, was able to negotiate the best terms with its suppliers, and had not wasted time and money on unnecessary acquisitions. It was not perfectly robust, but it was resilient enough. Today, the company is debt free and continues to be the industry leader by a wide margin.
The more levels of robustness, the more we salivate.
Highly Robust Businesses Evolve by Taking Calculated Risks
As we have learned, neutral mutations make an organism robust while simultaneously planting the seeds of evolution. In the business world, neutral changes may not have a short-term impact but may be transformational over the long run. The corporate phenomenon equivalent to biological neutral mutations can be summarized in two words: calculated risks.
There are millions of small businesses across the world that are incredibly robust but will stay small. And then there are businesses that test the limits of robustness and implode. The former risk nothing, and the latter risk everything. The Goldilocks zone between these two extremes is what I call “calculated risk.” It is the degree of risk that makes managers uncomfortable, but not too much; it compels the organization to innovate, but not too much; it forces the business to invest, but not too much; and it adds areas of potential growth, but not too many.
To me, the company that best demonstrates calculated aggression and risk-taking is Walmart.
Small digression. Let’s see if you know the answer to this question: What was Sam Walton’s age when he founded Walmart? If your answer begins with a one or a two, your answer was the same as mine. And like I was, you are wrong. Sam Walton was forty-four when he opened his first Wal-Mart store in 1962 in Rogers, Arkansas (Wal-Mart became Walmart in 2018).13 Not all the great founders of the modern era are from Silicon Valley, not all of them were hard-charging teenagers, and not all of them wanted to “change the world.”
After graduating from college, Walton started in sales at J. C. Penney in 1940, then enlisted for the war in 1942. In 1945, he started managing a franchise Ben Franklin store in Newport, Arkansas (where the population was then seven thousand). By 1950 he was running two stores in Newport and had achieved reasonable success by experimenting and innovating. One of his innovative ideas that had been a massive hit with his customers was an ice cream machine. As he writes in his autobiography, “Every crazy thing we tried hadn’t turned out as well as the ice cream machine, of course, but we hadn’t made any mistakes we couldn’t correct quickly, none so big that they threatened the business.”
Could there be a better definition of calculated risk?
After Walmart’s initial success in Rogers, Sam Walton opened more stores.14 By 1967, he had opened twenty-four stores, which brought in sales of about $13 million. The company reached $1 billion in sales in 1980, by which time it had 276 stores and about 21,000 associates. Note that store openings and selling more products through the same stores propelled growth from 1967 to 1980. During these thirteen years, sales per store had increased about seven times. How had Walton done this? By continuously trying new things, expanding product offerings, and broadening the customer base.
Not all these experiments were successful. For example, in the early 1980s, Walton started two Hypermarts—giant stores selling groceries and general merchandise—in the Dallas–Fort Worth area. But the concept failed. He also experimented with discounted drugs (dot Discount Drug) and home improvement (Save Mor), both of which shuttered. One of his experiments, however, worked spectacularly well. Sam’s Club, focused on retailers who buy in bulk, was launched in 1983, and within a decade, it had crossed revenue of $10 billion. The spectacular success of Sam’s Club demonstrates the slight downside and colossal upside of taking manageable risks.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">好的，这是根据您要求翻译的段落：

因此，即使在疫情期间，A公司也获得了可观的投入资本回报率（ROCE），使其能够投资于增长。凭借20%的ROCE，A公司若需要也可在市场上借款，因为其债务成本仅为5%，且公司本身无负债。而在疫情前表现尚可的B公司，则面临被淘汰的风险，因为它已无资金投资于生产、营销和分销。其4%的ROCE使其难以支付5%的债务利息。考虑到其岌岌可危的资产负债表和利润下滑，贷款机构也不愿向其提供更多资金。

至少在短期内，一个可能的结果是A公司获得市场份额，而B公司进一步丧失其地位。由于A公司凭借高ROCE拥有更强的韧性，它能够在不利的外部环境中适应并进化。

我所概述的并非理论构建。我们在许多业务中目睹了这一过程。当疫情开始时，普遍观点认为所有印度企业都将遭受打击。2020年3月和4月股市的急剧下跌反映了这种看法。然而，随着时间推移，韧性程度不同的公司所受影响的差异变得极为显著。在新冠疫情危机期间及之后，我们看到这种差异化的结果出现在我们众多公司和行业中，无论是涂料、内衣、空调、轮胎、管材还是电池。

我们投资组合中管理最佳的公司之一是佩奇工业（Page Industries），我们非常幸运地在2008年末雷曼兄弟倒闭几天后买入了它。佩奇是乔基（Jockey）品牌在印度的独家授权商，也是该国最大的内衣销售商。佩奇在疫情期间积极推出新产品并开设新店，而它的许多竞争对手要么消失，要么被严重削弱。

印度有四家上市的内衣公司，另外三家是麦克斯韦（Maxwell）、鲁帕（Rupa）和乐华宝（Lovable）。2018年12月，佩奇在其上市同行中的市场份额已相对较高，达到66%。然而到2020年12月，佩奇的市场份额增长至70%。我们没有数十家非上市公司的数据，但根据坊间证据和业内人士的反馈，佩奇在疫情期间相对于这一群体的市场份额增长似乎更大。

我认为佩奇的韧性是其能在危机中持续取得成功的一个重要（即使不是主要或唯一）原因。让我们看看佩奇在表3.1所列的各项韧性因素上表现如何。在截至2020年3月的财年，佩奇的ROCE为63%，且无负债。它拥有高度分散的客户和供应商基础。在我看来，通过过去二十五年在品牌和分销上的投入，它已构建了一条既深且宽的护城河。自1995年以来，其所有者未曾改变。其行业发展非常缓慢，头部企业十多年来保持不变。

韧性越强，进化能力就越强。

**我们要求业务具备多层次的韧性**

从我们到35亿年前的最后一个共同祖先（科学家称之为LUCA）之间，存在着一条不间断的生命链条。这条不间断且不断进化的谱系的每个部分都拥有多个层次的韧性：基因、蛋白质和身体结构，仅举三例。以一种并非不相似的方式，我在二十多年的投资中发现，韧性层次越多，进化能力就越强。

让我们回顾一下表3.1，它列出了七个韧性因素。正如我所提到的，还可以构想出更多因素（例如并购倾向、公司治理），但我们目前仍以这七个为主。我的目标是指引你方向，而非填鸭式灌输。

我们希望我们的公司在所有因素上都倾向于表3.1的左侧。因此，我们希望业务在ROCE、客户集中度、杠杆程度、竞争优势强度等层面都具有韧性。

这要求很高吗？当然。我们是永久所有者——关键在于“永久”。如果一个企业无法永久存续，我们就不想拥有它。没有多层次的韧性，我们如何确信业务能长期生存？我希望我能明确回答“这是一个有韧性的企业吗？”这个问题。作为一名实践中的投资者，我深知评估韧性是判断问题，且此过程没有捷径。经过多年投资，我得出了一种启发式方法。韧性显然存在黑白分明的极端情况（例如，一个只有两个客户的企业），但在许多、甚至可能是大多数企业中，我们面对的是灰色地带。

例如，一个债务/权益比为2.0的公司有韧性吗？可能没有。那0.2或0.5的比率呢？也许吧。对我来说，答案取决于其他韧性因素。我们投资组合中几乎所有公司都无负债。然而在2010年，我们投资了印度领先的塑料管材（用于家居和农业）企业Supreme Industries，其债务/EBITDA比率为0.6。不算高，但也不为零。尽管该公司有负债——其初始负债规模很小——我们仍认为该公司具有韧性，因为它是明确的行业领导者，市场份额持续超越竞争对手，资本回报率超过30%，过去十年成功设计和推出了许多产品，在印度拥有数千个分销点，能够与供应商谈判获得最佳条款，并且没有在不必要的收购上浪费时间和金钱。它并非完美无缺，但足够坚韧。如今，该公司已无负债，并继续以巨大优势保持行业领导地位。

韧性层次越多，我们越为之心动。

**高韧性企业通过有把握的风险实现进化**

正如我们所知，中性突变使生物体具有韧性的同时，也为进化埋下了种子。在商业世界中，中性变化可能短期内没有影响，但长期可能带来变革。与生物学中性突变等效的企业现象可以概括为两个词：**有把握的风险**（calculated risks）。

全球有数百万家极其稳健但规模注定不大的小企业。也有企业挑战韧性的极限而内爆。前者不冒任何风险，后者则押上一切。这两个极端之间的“金凤花区”（Goldilocks zone）就是我所说的“有把握的风险”。它是让管理者感到不适但不过度的风险程度；它迫使组织创新但不过度；它强迫企业投资但不过量；它增加潜在增长领域但不过多。

在我看来，最能体现有把握的进取和冒险精神的公司是沃尔玛（Walmart）。

稍微离题一下。看看你是否知道这个问题的答案：山姆·沃尔顿（Sam Walton）创立沃尔玛时多大年纪？如果你的答案是以一或二开头，那你的答案和我当初一样。而和我当初一样，你错了。1962年，44岁的山姆·沃尔顿在阿肯色州的罗杰斯市开设了第一家沃尔玛商店（Wal-Mart于2018年更名为Walmart）。并非所有现代伟大的创始人都来自硅谷，并非所有人都是斗志昂扬的青少年，也并非所有人都想“改变世界”。

大学毕业后，沃尔顿于1940年在J.C. Penney开始销售工作，随后于1942年应征入伍。1945年，他开始在阿肯色州的纽波特市（当时人口七千）管理一家Ben Franklin特许经营店。到1950年，他已在纽波特经营两家店铺，并通过实验和创新取得了相当的成功。他一个广受顾客欢迎的创新想法是安装冰淇淋机。正如他在自传中所写：“当然，我们尝试的每件疯狂事都不如冰淇淋机成功，但我们没有犯下任何无法迅速纠正的错误，也没有任何大到威胁企业生存的错误。”

还有比这更好的“有把握的风险”定义吗？

沃尔玛在罗杰斯取得初步成功后，山姆·沃尔顿开设了更多门店。到1967年，他已开设24家门店，销售额约1300万美元。公司于1980年达到10亿美元销售额，当时拥有276家门店和约21,000名员工。请注意，从1967年到1980年的增长主要源于开设新店以及通过原有门店销售更多产品。在这十三年间，单店销售额增长了约七倍。沃尔顿是如何做到的？通过不断尝试新事物、扩展产品种类和拓宽客户群。

并非所有尝试都成功。例如，在1980年代初，沃尔顿在达拉斯-沃斯堡地区开设了两家HyperMart——销售杂货和日用百货的大型商店。但这一概念失败了。他还尝试了折扣药店（dot Discount Drug）和家装（Save Mor），两者均告关闭。然而，他的一项尝试取得了巨大成功。专注于批量采购零售商的“山姆会员店”（Sam’s Club）于1983年推出，十年内收入就突破了100亿美元。山姆会员店的巨大成功证明了承担可控风险的微小下行空间和巨大上行空间。</div>

            <span class="paragraph-number">5.</span>
            <div class="text-block original-text">As discussed in chapter 1, most M&A fail, and the larger ones can destroy a business. Walmart has managed acquisitions the way they should be managed: It has kept targets small and manageable and funded them without taking on large debt. The company made its first acquisition fifteen years after inception. It was close to $500 million in sales, and by this time, as is evident from his autobiography, Sam Walton was feeling quite confident about the future of the business. Even then, he behaved prudently by acquiring a small discount store business called Mohr Value in 1977, which was about one-tenth the size of Walmart. As he says in his book, “We closed five stores and converted the remaining sixteen to Wal-Marts, and it wasn’t much of a shock to our system.”
By 1991, Walmart was present in forty-nine states, and the management started exploring options outside their home country. Almost two decades after the first store’s inauguration, Walmart embarked on its maiden international foray by entering into a joint venture with CIFRA, Mexico’s largest retailer, and by 1997 it had acquired a majority position in CIFRA. Was this a “neutral” change? It sure seems like one in hindsight—the Mexico joint venture started small and would not have impacted Walmart’s U.S. operations. Also, a joint venture in a foreign country allowed Walmart to dip a toe to check the water temperature. Once the company had adjusted to the new geography, it felt confident in making a bigger commitment by acquiring the rest of CIFRA. Starting from scratch in 1991, Walmart’s revenue from the international segment in 2020 was $120 billion, or 23 percent of company sales.15
The company did something similar—small, measured, and low risk—when it launched its web business. In 2000, Walmart joined hands with a leading Silicon Valley investment firm, Accel Partners, to launch Walmart.com. Accel, by the way, gained much fame (and a gargantuan fortune) as a result of its $12.7 million investment in an early-stage company called Facebook in 2005.16 In about eighteen months, in mid-2001, Walmart acquired the minority stake of Accel to own Walmart.com fully. By 2020, Walmart’s e-commerce sales had climbed to $24 billion and Walmart.com was approaching 10 percent of Walmart’s overall U.S. sales. What had started as a “neutral” strategy in 2000 is now fast becoming the centerpiece of Walmart’s approach to gaining market share.
One of our largest investors is a well-known U.S. university endowment. They have been investing in funds globally for many decades. Their CFO visited our Singapore office in 2011. After he had finished grilling us on compliance and other related matters, I wanted to know if he could share any learnings with us. He said that the one industry in which their fund managers had consistently lost money across time and geographies was retailing. In this context, Walmart’s success is awe inspiring.
And how robust was Walmart at the end of 2020? Let me point to just two indicators. Its return on tangible capital employed was 46 percent. Thus, for day-to-day operations in 2020, it deployed $49.7 billion capital to earn an operating income of $22.9 billion. Its net debt level was just $26.8 billion, substantially lower than its equity value of $52 billion and EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) of $38 billion. Its continued robustness has helped the management take calculated risks in the United States, as well as across the globe.
I don’t want to pretend that Walmart’s success is solely the result of its slow-and-steady approach to growth and expansion. Walmart has undoubtedly flourished for many reasons. Apart from Sam Walton being the founder, though, I don’t know what other factors have led to its success. I can rattle off a list of things from various business books and articles written on Walmart, but I don’t know if they were the cause or the effect of its success. But I do know that taking calculated risks and staying robustly healthy have had a strong correlation with its accomplishments over sixty years.
As it has been for almost all the Nalanda portfolio companies. When we first invested in Page Industries in 2008, it primarily manufactured and sold men’s innerwear. Here are some of the milestones and neutral strategies implemented by Page since then:
2008–09: Primarily a men’s innerwear company
2009–10: Launched women’s leisurewear, men’s sportswear
2010–11: First store for women in Delhi, first training center for production staff
2011–12: Boys’ and girls’ ranges, signed exclusive licensee agreement with Speedo
2012–13: Sleepwear range for women, men’s performance stretch range, thermals
2013–14: New international-format retail outlets, seamless sleepwear for women
2014–15: Exclusive outlets in Dubai, Abu Dhabi
2015–16: Boys’ collection (7–12 years)
2017–18: Girls’ inner- and outerwear, men’s and women’s athleisure
2018–19: Teenage girls’ range
2019–20: First digital manufacturing unit with real-time production data
The remarkable aspect of this list is what it doesn’t include. There are no acquisitions, no unrelated diversifications, no “visionary” plans to change the world, no financial engineering. Only measured risks. For example, in 2009–10, the company launched men’s sportswear. It did so through its existing distribution channel and staff, its current manufacturing units, and the same brand name. As the sportswear segment has expanded over the years, it now has its own supply chain, its own business unit, and its own advertisements.
You will notice here that the company launched a children’s range in 2011–12. Page describes this natural extension of the Jockey brand in its annual report: “With the launch of Jockey Kids, the brand reaches out to the consumers of tomorrow. . . . Keeping comfort as our topmost priority, we have brought in a range using 100 percent cotton, super soft, absorbent fabric, for both boys and girls.” As investors in Page, we were excited about this new target segment because it would double the Jockey brand’s addressable market.
After seventeen years in India, Page had earned the right to extend its brand into a new segment. Unexpectedly, it failed. The children’s range did not do well, and the company withdrew its products. Did this have any negative impact on the finance or operations of the company? No. This is because it was a calculated risk. It was a neutral strategy that did not affect the robustness of the business. Its operating ROCE in 2011–12 was 59 percent and was even higher in 2012–13 (when it realized the children’s range had failed) at 64 percent. In 2012–13, overall sales grew 26 percent, and profits rose 24 percent. In both these years, the company had negligible debt. The advantage of having a solid foundation that allowed it to take small bets was evident.
Page went back to the drawing board and launched only a boys’ collection in 2015–16. Even within this segment, it introduced products only for boys aged seven to twelve years. Why not five- or thirteen-year-old boys? I have no idea. I don’t understand product marketing, but thankfully Page does. It launched girls’ inner- and outerwear a year later. By 2020, the boys’ and girls’ ranges had become a hit and had started contributing to the overall sales and profit growth of the business. What had started as a small experiment in 2011–12 was finally yielding fruit.
As India went into a full lockdown in mid-March 2020 owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company’s annual sales grew only 3 percent for the year ended March 2020. Profits fell 15 percent, but it delivered ROCE of 63 percent while remaining debt free. This robustness, we believe, should allow the company to continue to take calculated strategic bets many years into the future.
Robustness Is a Proxy for Evolutionary and Business Success but Doesn’t Guarantee It
Dinosaurs, a diverse group of more than a thousand reptilian species, dominated our planet for 180 million years.17 As a matter of comparison, we Homo sapiens have been around for less than 0.2 million years. Dinosaurs couldn’t have survived and thrived for so long unless they were highly robust and adaptable. Molecular evidence has shown that many modern mammalian orders—Carnivora, Primata, Proboscidea—coexisted with dinosaurs for at least 30 million years during the Cretaceous period (145 to 66 million years ago), and maybe even earlier. The mammals during the era of dinosaurs were small, squirrel sized, and probably insectivores. If aliens had landed on our planet 65 million years ago, they never could have predicted that a small offshoot of the insignificant mammalians would reign supreme one day.
The cataclysmic aftermath of an asteroid strike in the Yucatan peninsula 65 million years ago wiped out the dinosaurs. But the mammals survived. No one is sure why. The extraordinary robustness of dinosaurs did not guarantee their evolvability.
In general, the greater the robustness, the greater the evolvability. But sometimes, robustness ceases to help businesses adapt. We can see this in Gap’s failure to grow despite the company being very robust. Its revenue stayed flat at about $16 billion from 2005 to 2020, although it delivered ROCE of 20 percent or more for more than a decade and had no leverage. In general, multiple levels of robustness are better than a single level. But sometimes, even multiple levels of robustness can’t safeguard the future of a business, as has been the case for thousands of newspapers across the world. In general, highly robust businesses evolve by taking calculated risks. But sometimes, very rarely, businesses can succeed by taking huge risks, as shown by Netflix.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">好的，这是根据您的要求翻译的段落：

如第一章所述，大多数并购都以失败告终，大型并购甚至会摧毁一家企业。沃尔玛以应有的方式管理收购：保持收购目标规模小且易于管理，并通过自有资金进行收购，避免承担巨额债务。公司成立十五年后才进行首次收购。当时其销售额已接近5亿美元，从山姆·沃尔顿的自传中可以明显看出，此时他对公司的未来已相当有信心。即便如此，他仍谨慎行事，于1977年收购了名为Mohr Value的小型折扣连锁店，其规模仅为沃尔玛的十分之一左右。正如他在书中所言：“我们关闭了五家门店，将剩余的十六家改造为沃尔玛门店，这对我们的体系冲击不大。”

到1991年，沃尔玛已覆盖美国49个州，管理层开始探索海外市场。首家门店开业近二十年后，沃尔玛通过与墨西哥最大零售商CIFRA建立合资企业，首次进军国际市场，并于1997年取得了CIFRA的控股权。这是一次“中性”变革吗？事后看来确实如此——墨西哥合资企业规模小，并未影响沃尔玛的美国业务。此外，在外国建立合资企业使沃尔玛得以小规模试水，探测市场水温。一旦公司适应了新市场环境，便信心十足地通过收购CIFRA剩余股权做出了更大承诺。从1991年零起点开始，沃尔玛2020年的国际业务收入已达1200亿美元，占公司总销售额的23%。

公司在启动网络业务时也采取了类似做法——规模小、有节制、低风险。2000年，沃尔玛联手硅谷领先风投公司Accel Partners创建了Walmart.com。值得一提的是，Accel因2005年向一家名为Facebook的初创公司投资1270万美元而声名鹊起（并积累了巨额财富）。大约十八个月后，即2001年年中，沃尔玛收购了Accel的少数股权，从而全资拥有了Walmart.com。到2020年，沃尔玛的电子商务销售额已攀升至240亿美元，Walmart.com占沃尔玛美国总销售额的比例接近10%。2000年启动的这项“中性”策略，如今正迅速成为沃尔玛获取市场份额的核心策略。

我们最大的投资者之一是美国一所知名大学的捐赠基金。数十年来，他们一直在全球范围内投资基金。2011年，其首席财务官访问了我们的新加坡办公室。在就合规等事宜盘问完毕后，我询问他是否能分享一些经验。他说，其基金经理无论何时何地都持续亏损的行业是零售业。在此背景下，沃尔玛的成功令人惊叹。

那么2020年底的沃尔玛有多强健？仅举两项指标：其有形资本回报率（ROCE）高达46%。这意味着在2020年的日常运营中，它投入了497亿美元资本，赚取了229亿美元营业利润。其净债务水平仅为268亿美元，远低于520亿美元的股权价值和380亿美元的息税折旧摊销前利润（EBITDA）。持续的强健使管理层得以在美国及全球审慎地承担风险。

我不想假装沃尔玛的成功完全归功于其稳健的发展扩张策略。毫无疑问，沃尔玛的繁荣源于多种因素。除了创始人山姆·沃尔顿之外，我并不清楚其他促成成功的因素。我可以列举众多关于沃尔玛的商业书籍和文章中的观点，但无法确定它们是成功的原因还是结果。但我确信，审慎承担风险与保持强健体魄，与其六十年的成就密切相关。

那兰达投资组合中的几乎所有公司亦是如此。2008年我们首次投资Page Industries时，其主要产销男士内衣。以下是Page此后实施的部分里程碑和中性策略：
2008-09年：主营男士内衣
2009-10年：推出女士休闲服、男士运动服
2010-11年：德里开设首家女士专卖店，首个生产人员培训中心
2011-12年：推出童装系列，与Speedo签署独家授权协议
2012-13年：推出女士睡衣系列、男士弹性运动服、保暖内衣
2013-14年：开设新型国际零售店，推出女士无缝睡衣
2014-15年：在迪拜、阿布扎比开设专卖店
2015-16年：推出男童系列（7-12岁）
2017-18年：推出女童内外衣、男女运动休闲服
2018-19年：推出少女系列
2019-20年：首个实时生产数据的数字化制造单元
此清单的非凡之处在于其未包含的内容：没有收购，没有无关多元化，没有改变世界的“宏伟”计划，没有财务操作。只有有节制的风险承担。例如，2009-10年公司推出男士运动服时，利用的是现有分销渠道、员工、制造工厂和同一品牌。随着运动服板块逐年扩张，如今已拥有独立的供应链、业务部门和广告宣传。

您会注意到公司在2011-12年推出了童装系列。Page在其年报中描述Jockey品牌的这一自然延伸：“随着Jockey Kids的推出，品牌将触达未来的消费者……以舒适为首要考量，我们为男童女童推出了采用100%棉质、超柔软、吸湿面料的产品系列。”作为Page的投资者，我们对这一新目标群体感到兴奋，因为它将使Jockey品牌的可触达市场扩大一倍。

在印度经营十七年后，Page获得了将品牌延伸至新领域的资格。但出乎意料的是，它失败了。童装系列表现不佳，公司撤回了产品。这对公司的财务或运营造成负面影响了吗？没有。因为这是一次审慎的风险尝试。这是一项中性策略，并未影响业务的强健性。2011-12年的营运资本回报率（ROCE）为59%，2012-13年（即发现童装失败之年）甚至更高，达64%。2012-13年整体销售额增长26%，利润增长24%。这两年公司债务几乎可忽略不计。拥有坚实基础使其能进行小额尝试的优势显而易见。

Page重新规划，仅在2015-16年推出了男童系列。即使在这一细分市场，也只推出了7至12岁男童产品。为何不包含5岁或13岁男童？我不得而知。我不懂产品营销，但幸好Page懂。一年后，公司推出了女童内外衣。到2020年，童装系列大受欢迎，并开始推动公司整体销售和利润增长。2011-12年的小规模尝试终于结出硕果。

2020年3月中旬，印度因新冠疫情全面封锁，公司截至2020年3月的财年销售额仅增长3%，利润下降15%，但仍实现了63%的ROCE且零负债。我们相信，这种强健性将使公司未来多年能继续审慎地承担战略性风险。

**强健是进化与商业成功的表征，但非保证**

恐龙——一个包含上千种爬行动物的多样化群体——曾统治地球1.8亿年。相比之下，我们智人存在的时间不足20万年。恐龙若非高度强健且适应性强，不可能生存繁衍如此之久。分子证据显示，许多现代哺乳动物目——食肉目、灵长目、长鼻目——在白垩纪（1.45亿至6600万年前）甚至更早时期，已与恐龙共存至少3000万年。恐龙时代的哺乳动物体型如松鼠般大小，可能以昆虫为食。若6500万年前外星人造访地球，他们绝不可能预料到，这类微不足道哺乳动物中的一小支系有朝一日会主宰世界。

6500万年前尤卡坦半岛小行星撞击的灾难性后果灭绝了恐龙。但哺乳动物幸存下来。无人确知原因。恐龙非凡的强健性并未保证其进化能力。

通常，强健性越高，进化能力越强。但有时，强健性无法帮助企业适应变革。我们可在Gap的案例中看到这点：尽管公司非常强健，却未能增长。2005至2020年间其收入停滞在约160亿美元，尽管其ROCE连续十多年保持在20%以上且无负债。通常，多层次的强健性优于单一层次。但有时，即使多层次强健性也无法保障企业未来，全球数千家报社便是例证。通常，高度强健的企业通过审慎承担风险实现进化。但有时（极为罕见），企业亦可通过承担巨大风险获得成功，Netflix便是一例。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">We at Nalanda never bet against the odds. And so, despite some rare counterexamples, we have kept and will continue to keep robustness at the front and center of our investment approach. As permanent owners, we seek robustness in companies as the best available benchmark to assess if they are likely to adapt and survive over the long term. A better measure may exist, but I don’t know what it is. We invest only in highly robust companies. Many of them have stayed robust and have grown their sales and profits over decades. But our track record is not perfect. We have witnessed two key problems with this approach.
First, a business can lose its robustness. We saw this happen to one of our consumer-focused companies; we still don’t know how or why it lost its way. We invested in this business almost twenty years after its creation. During that period, the management had built the largest brand in its industry in the country. When we invested, the company had no debt, its sales had grown 20 percent annually for the past five years, and it had delivered ROCE of more than 50 percent. Within a few years of our investing, the company’s inventory and receivables started climbing steeply, a leading indicator of potential sales issues. While the company continued to show profits, it had begun consuming cash—while having been a cash generator in earlier years. As a result, it had to start borrowing money just as its ability to repay the loans declined. Being a permanent owner, we are tolerant of declining sales or margins or market share. But we will not risk survivability. As the company’s robustness nose-dived, we exited the business at a loss. The company survives but is a pale reflection of its former glory. This unexplained decline of robustness has occurred in our portfolio only once since our inception in 2007, but it has happened.
The second problem is too much robustness. One high-quality business in the Nalanda portfolio has been too robust. It has been unable or unwilling to implement any neutral strategies to expand its customer base, product segments, or geographies. As a result, the company has grown its sales at less than 5 percent annually for a decade, and its profits have stayed flat during this period. To be fair, its industry has gone through a vicious downcycle, and this business is the only one among its peers that continues to generate profits and free cash flow, and it remains debt free. It is also the only business in our portfolio that has taken robustness to its extreme by eschewing calculated risks. Maybe it is in an industry in which it can’t or shouldn’t. Perhaps when the industry upcycle arrives, it will finally see growth. Or maybe not. We will continue to remain owners in the business. While our returns have been positive, they have been below par. But I love them—they are a class apart in a very tough place. We are willing to sacrifice growth for robustness.
We have made almost forty investments to date, and in all of them, robustness was a primary—but not the only—selection criterion. We have worked on the assumption that robustness will lead to growth and evolution. This assumption has failed us on two occasions: one in which the company lost robustness and another in which the company’s excessive focus on robustness compromised growth. I am surprised at our strategy’s low failure rate. We have been quite lucky, and while robustness should continue to reward us across our portfolio, we will continue to encounter failures of the first or second kind over time.
The Only Way to Protect Against Loss of Robustness Is Entry Valuation
“Confronted with a like challenge to distill the secret of sound investment into three words, we venture the motto, MARGIN OF SAFETY” (emphasis in the original text). This is the best advice for investors in the best chapter of the best investing book ever written: The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham, Buffett’s actual and spiritual mentor. The chapter is titled “ ‘Margin of Safety’ as the Central Concept of Investment.” Graham knew that the corporate world is highly uncertain and that the best protection offered to an investor is the price they pay for a business.
Another investment legend, Seth Klarman, offers the following advice in his book appropriately titled Margin of Safety: Risk-Averse Value Investing Strategies for the Thoughtful Investor: “Value investing, the strategy of investing in securities trading at an appreciable discount from underlying value, has a long history of delivering excellent investment results with very limited downside risk.”
In this chapter, I have used the word “robust” to extend the margin-of-safety concept to many other facets of a company. We have sought a margin of safety on business quality by demanding high ROCE and a wide competitive moat, on the strength of the balance sheet by requiring it to be debt free, on the bargaining power of customers and suppliers by requiring them to be fragmented, and on the sustainability of economics by insisting that the industry be slow-changing.
But even these multiple levels of robustness or margins of safety can become compromised owing to unpredictable changes in the economy, the industry, or the company. The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted what had appeared to be highly robust hotel chains; Intel’s erstwhile dominance in semiconductor chips has been upset by the likes of AMD, Nvidia, and Samsung; Amazon has already destroyed many small and large retail businesses; regulators in the United States and Europe appear to be threatening the very existence of Google and Facebook in their current form.
We do the best we can to choose businesses based on their current and potential degree of robustness. But bad things will happen—we just don’t know what, when, or how. And so we turn to the one aspect of investing that is entirely within our control: the price we pay.
We know that given the nature of the businesses we are after—those with very low risk and exceptional business quality—they will almost never be available cheap. The market is not an idiot; it is almost always efficient. Almost always. Not always. We wait for those few occasions to pay what we call a “fair” price. Not too low but not too high either.
What is “fair”? Rather than describe it, let me state the actual number. The median trailing twelve-month (TTM) entry PE ratio for the Nalanda portfolio is 14.9. The median TTM PE for the period from 2005 to 2020 for India’s primary index, Sensex, is 19.7 and for the Midcap Index is 23.8. Thus, we are buying what we think are exceptional businesses at a 25 to 30 percent discount on the index.
Over almost a quarter of a century of investing, I know I have been wrong on many occasions. The margin of safety of our entry price pays for my errors of judgment.
A Leader Is Made a Loser
Lazarus of Bethany was miraculously brought back to life by Jesus in the New Testament.18 Charles Lazarus performed a modern capitalist miracle by making Toys “R” Us the largest and most well-respected toy business globally. Lazarus is also a beggar in a parable in the Gospel according to Luke, the third of the four Gospels of the New Testament. Once a miracle of Lazarus, Toys “R” Us suffered the same fate as Lazarus the beggar.
Charles Lazarus opened his first Toys “R” Us store in 1957.19 In that era, parents typically went to department stores to buy toys. Toy sales were seasonal, and the six weeks leading up to Christmas made up the bulk of sales for the year. Most toy stores were small family-run shops and carried only a small number of toys. Having operated a baby furniture business from 1948 to 1957 and learned the shopping habits of parents, Lazarus decided to risk a new strategy. He wanted to sell toys throughout the year and give parents and children a novel shopping experience. His first store was 25,000 square feet in size and stocked thousands of toy varieties. The store did not keep toys in display cases as did its competitors; instead, it kept them in rows next to each other like items in a grocery store.
The store was a massive hit given its size, variety, and low prices. Despite his initial success, Lazarus moved slowly at first and opened only four stores until 1966. In 1973, Toys “R” Us started advertising on TV using its store mascot, a cuddly giraffe called Geoffrey. Lazarus also began tapping Japanese manufacturers to make inexpensive toys and negotiated attractive rates for bulk purchases. The company went public in 1978 and grew at more than 20 percent annually for the next decade. Morgan Stanley’s retail analyst compared it to the venerable IBM in 1982: “I think Toys ‘R’ Us is a unique operation—the only proprietary merchandise company that rivals IBM as revolutionary in concept.” The Washington Post compared it to another iconic American brand, McDonald’s, by declaring, “Like McDonald’s, with its regimented service and standardized burgers and fries, Toys ‘R’ Us has become an American institution.”
Toys “R” Us kept gaining market share by opening stores slowly and steadily. It did not get enticed by “transformational” M&A, although I am sure there was no dearth of bankers paying their respects to Lazarus every week. It continued, however, to take measured risks, one of which was the opening of a Kids “R” Us clothing store in 1983. The company also started expanding overseas and, in 1984, opened its first international stores in Canada and Singapore. In 1985, the company opened five stores in the United Kingdom, and in 1991 they entered Japan in an 80:20 joint venture with McDonald’s. In the United Kingdom, Toys “R” Us captured a 9 percent market share in just three years. The company continued to expand in overseas markets after its initial successes.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">好的，这是根据您的要求翻译的书籍段落：

在纳兰达，我们从不与概率对赌。因此，尽管存在少数罕见的反例，我们过去、现在并将继续把稳健性置于我们投资方法的核心位置。作为永久所有者，我们寻求公司的稳健性，将其作为评估它们能否长期适应并生存的最佳可用基准。或许存在更好的衡量标准，但我不知道那是什么。我们只投资于高度稳健的公司。其中许多公司数十年来保持稳健，并实现了销售和利润的增长。但我们的记录并非完美无缺。我们见证了这种方法存在的两个关键问题。

首先，企业可能会丧失其稳健性。我们目睹了这一点发生在我们投资的一家面向消费者的公司身上；我们至今仍不清楚它是如何或为何迷失方向的。我们在这家公司成立近二十年后对其进行了投资。在此期间，管理层建立了国内该行业最大的品牌。我们投资时，公司没有负债，过去五年销售额年均增长20%，资本回报率（ROCE）超过50%。在我们投资后的几年内，公司的库存和应收账款开始急剧攀升，这是潜在销售问题的先兆。虽然公司仍显示盈利，但它开始消耗现金——而在早些年它曾是现金创造者。结果，就在其偿债能力下降之时，它不得不开始借款。作为永久所有者，我们能容忍销售额、利润率或市场份额的下降。但我们不会拿生存能力冒险。随着公司稳健性直线下降，我们亏损退出了这项业务。该公司虽存续至今，但已今非昔比。自2007年成立以来，这种无法解释的稳健性丧失在我们的投资组合中仅发生过一次，但它确实发生了。

第二个问题是稳健性过度。纳兰达投资组合中的一家高质量企业就稳健性过度。它一直未能或不愿实施任何中性战略来扩展其客户群、产品线或地域范围。结果，十年来其销售额年均增长率不到5%，利润在此期间持平。公平地说，其所在行业经历了残酷的下行周期，而该企业是同行中唯一持续盈利并产生自由现金流的，且仍无负债。它也是我们投资组合中唯一一家通过规避经过计算的风险而将稳健性推向极致的企业。也许它所在的行业使其不能或不应该冒险。或许当行业上行周期到来时，它最终会迎来增长。又或许不会。我们将继续作为所有者持有这家企业。虽然我们的回报是正的，但低于平均水平。但我欣赏它们——在一个非常艰难的环境中，它们是独树一帜的存在。我们愿意为了稳健性而牺牲增长。

迄今为止，我们进行了近四十项投资，在所有投资中，稳健性是主要的（但非唯一的）选择标准。我们一直以来的假设是，稳健性将带来增长和演进。这一假设在两种情况下令我们失望：一种是公司丧失了稳健性，另一种是公司过度关注稳健性而损害了增长。我对我们策略的低失败率感到惊讶。我们相当幸运，尽管稳健性应会继续在整个投资组合中回报我们，但随着时间的推移，我们仍将继续遭遇第一类或第二类失败。

**防范稳健性丧失的唯一方法是买入估值**

“面对将稳健投资的秘诀浓缩为三个字的类似挑战，我们斗胆提出这个座右铭：‘安全边际’”（原文强调）。这是有史以来最伟大的投资书籍《聪明的投资者》中最佳章节给投资者的最佳建议，该书作者本杰明·格雷厄姆是巴菲特实际和精神的导师。该章节标题为“‘安全边际’作为投资的中心思想”。格雷厄姆深知商业世界充满高度不确定性，而能为投资者提供的最佳保护就是他们为一项业务所支付的价格。

另一位投资传奇人物塞思·卡拉曼在其恰如其分地命名为《安全边际：深思熟虑投资者的风险规避价值投资策略》一书中给出了如下建议：“价值投资，即在证券价格相对于其内在价值存在显著折价时进行投资的策略，在提供卓越投资结果的同时，其下行风险极其有限，这一历史由来已久。”

在本章中，我使用“稳健”一词将安全边际的概念延伸到公司的许多其他方面。我们在业务质量上寻求安全边际，要求高资本回报率和宽阔的竞争护城河；在资产负债表强度上寻求安全边际，要求零负债；在客户和供应商的议价能力上寻求安全边际，要求他们分散；在经济可持续性上寻求安全边际，坚持要求行业是缓慢变化的。

但即使是这些多层次的稳健性或安全边际，也可能因经济、行业或公司不可预测的变化而受到损害。COVID-19大流行严重冲击了那些看似高度稳健的连锁酒店；英特尔曾在半导体芯片领域的昔日主导地位已被超威半导体（AMD）、英伟达（Nvidia）和三星等公司动摇；亚马逊已经摧毁了许多大大小小的零售企业；美国和欧洲的监管机构似乎正威胁着谷歌和Facebook以其当前形式的存在。

我们尽最大努力根据企业当前和潜在的稳健程度来选择业务。但坏事总会发生——我们只是不知道会发生什么、何时发生或如何发生。因此，我们转向投资中完全在我们掌控之内的一个方面：我们支付的价格。

我们知道，鉴于我们所追求的业务性质——风险极低且业务质量卓越——它们几乎永远不会便宜。市场并非白痴；它几乎总是有效的。几乎总是。并非总是。我们等待为数不多的时机，支付我们所谓的“公平”价格。不太低，但也不太高。

什么是“公平”？与其描述，不如让我给出实际数字。纳兰达投资组合的买入市盈率（TTM）中位数为14.9倍。从2005年到2020年期间，印度主要指数Sensex的TTM市盈率中位数为19.7倍，中盘指数为23.8倍。因此，我们是以我们认为的卓越企业，并以相对于指数25%至30%的折价买入。

在近四分之一个世纪的投资生涯中，我知道自己多次出错。我们买入价格的安全边际为我的判断错误付出了代价。

**领导者沦为失败者**

新约圣经中，伯大尼的拉撒路被耶稣奇迹般地复活。查尔斯·拉撒路则通过将玩具反斗城（Toys “R” Us）打造成全球最大、最受尊敬的玩具企业，创造了一个现代资本主义奇迹。拉撒路也是新约四福音书之第三卷《路加福音》中一个寓言里的乞丐。曾为拉撒路式奇迹的玩具反斗城，最终却遭受了与乞丐拉撒路同样的命运。

查尔斯·拉撒路于1957年开设了他的第一家玩具反斗城商店。在那个时代，父母通常去百货公司购买玩具。玩具销售具有季节性，圣诞节前的六周构成了全年销售的大部分。大多数玩具店是小型家庭经营商店，只销售少量玩具。拉撒路在1948年至1957年经营婴儿家具业务期间了解了父母的购物习惯，他决定冒险尝试新策略。他希望全年销售玩具，并为父母和孩子提供新颖的购物体验。他的第一家店面积达25,000平方英尺，库存了数千种玩具。该店不像其竞争对手那样将玩具放在展示柜中，而是像杂货店里的商品一样，将它们一排排并列摆放。

凭借其规模、种类和低廉的价格，该店大获成功。尽管最初取得成功，拉撒路起初发展谨慎，直到1966年才开设了四家店。1973年，玩具反斗城开始使用其商店吉祥物——一只名为杰弗里的可爱长颈鹿在电视上做广告。拉撒路也开始利用日本制造商生产廉价玩具，并通过谈判获得批量采购的优惠价格。公司于1978年上市，并在接下来的十年里以超过20%的年增长率发展。摩根士丹利的零售分析师在1982年将其与受人尊敬的IBM相提并论：“我认为玩具反斗城是一家独特的公司——唯一一家在概念创新上与IBM匹敌的自有商品公司。”《华盛顿邮报》将其与另一个标志性美国品牌麦当劳相比较，宣称：“就像麦当劳以其规范化的服务和标准化的汉堡薯条一样，玩具反斗城已成为美国的标志。”

玩具反斗城通过稳健地开设新店不断获得市场份额。它没有受到“变革性”并购的诱惑，尽管我确信每周都不乏银行家向拉撒路致敬。然而，它继续承担着经过衡量的风险，其中之一是1983年开设了一家名为“儿童反斗城”（Kids “R” Us）的服装店。公司也开始向海外扩张，1984年在加拿大和新加坡开设了首批国际店。1985年，公司在英国开设了五家店，1991年通过与麦当劳80:20的合资企业进入日本市场。在英国，玩具反斗城仅用三年时间就占据了9%的市场份额。在取得初步成功后，公司继续在海外市场扩张。</div>

            <div class="text-block original-text">In 1988, the Wall Street Journal boldly predicted, “Toys ‘R’ Us, Big Kid on the Block, Won’t Stop Growing.” As if on cue, the problems started. In 1988, Walmart’s market share at 17.4 percent came marginally ahead of that of Toys “R” Us at 16.8 percent. Toys “R” Us was in second place after being the leader for fifteen years. Toys “R” Us was being squeezed at both ends: by discount chains like Walmart, Target, and Costco, which competed on low prices, and by so-called edutainment companies like Zany Brainy, Noodle Kidoodle, and Imaginarium, which offered higher-priced specialized toys and better service.
In 1998, the company launched its website, ToysRUs.com, and its first mail-order catalog. But the company was struggling, and 1998 was the year of “restructuring,” which is usually the euphemism for a business terminating its science projects and loss-making initiatives. The company announced a huge inventory reduction; the closure of fifty-nine stores in the United States, France, and Germany; the shuttering of thirty-nine Kids “R” Us stores; and a layoff of three thousand workers. The cost of restructuring was so high that the company declared its first net loss since going public.
Too often, a business in trouble tries to buy its way out. Toys “R” Us was no exception. It acquired Imaginarium Toy Centers in 1998. It also tried frequent management changes—the company had three CEOs from 1994 to 2000. But its downward slide continued with Amazon, too, muscling its way into the toy segment. The company’s sales stayed flat at $11 billion from 1997 to 2004, and the operating profit fell by about 65 percent during this period. The operating ROCE was 15 percent in 1997, and it fell to 4 percent in 2004. The situation was so bad that the company shocked the world by announcing that it might completely withdraw from the toy business and focus on the Babies “R” Us chain.
Okay, let’s pause here and summarize the situation in 2005.
Toys “R” Us was spectacularly successful for about four decades, from the late 1950s to the late 1990s. By the mid-2000s, however, it wasn’t growing, its market share was declining, and its profitability had taken a severe beating. Whatever the reasons for its trouble, there was no doubt that it was in trouble. The company’s robustness had suffered significantly. Maybe it was bad luck, maybe it was management missteps, or maybe it was a bit of both.
One way to think about this situation is to picture an elite marathoner whose performance has dipped in recent months. They used to be a picture of health and vigor, but nowadays, they look exhausted and cannot run even ten kilometers at their earlier marathon pace. They are now at the starting line of the Boston Marathon. What would you expect their coach to do before the race starts? If I were the coach, I would advise them to withdraw from the race, rest and recover for a few months, and slowly build their mileage back up. Maybe your advice would be different—you might counsel them to take it easy and just finish the race without worrying about a podium finish to minimize damage to the body. I assume you would be shocked if I told you that the coach not only asked them to run at full speed but also loaded a ten-pound bag on their back!
Yet this is what happened to Toys “R” Us. In 2005, the private equity giants KKR and Bain and the real estate firm Vornado purchased Toys “R” Us for $6.6 billion.20 However, their equity contribution was only $1.3 billion, and they borrowed $5.3 billion for this purchase. And then they loaded this borrowing onto Toys “R” Us! If you know nothing about the leveraged buyout (LBO) industry, you may be rubbing your eyes in disbelief. The private equity folks bought Toys “R” Us for a fat sum of money, borrowed 80 percent of that amount, and then burdened the company with this borrowing to finance their purchase? Oh, yes. Welcome to the wonderful world of finance.
While leverage may be good from a corporate finance perspective, it is bad from my point of view. But I hope all parties can agree that it is terrible for a struggling business. The elite but sick Toys “R” Us marathoner had just been asked to run the Boston Marathon, competing with world-class runners with a ten-pound load on its back. Remember that the capitalist world is a Boston Marathon that never ends—there is no respite at the end of a punishing two-hour race. The race goes on and on and on and on and on: 24 hours × 7 days a week × 365 days a year. It’s unending, unrelenting, unforgiving.
The massive debt load meant that by 2007, 97 percent of the company’s operating profit was consumed by interest payments. Where was the money left to innovate, invest in stores, advertise, hire and train the best people, and do all the things any business needs to do to stay on top of their game? In an Atlantic article on the failure of Toys “R” Us,21 an interviewee remarks that the company was handcuffed and could not make investments. Another one rightly points out, “It’s true that they could not respond to Amazon. But you have to ask yourself why.” Katherine Waldock, a finance professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business said in a Wall Street Journal article, “The $400 million a year in debt service was really constrictive as they were trying to compete.”
Toys “R” Us was already unrobust at multiple levels, and the additional leverage taken by its private equity owners proved to be the last straw. The company filed for bankruptcy in September 2017, and David Brandon, the CEO, candidly admitted, “The company’s overleveraged capital structure has constrained it from making necessary operational and capital expenditures, including investing in the revitalization of stores. As a result, the company has fallen behind some of its primary competitors on various fronts.” You don’t say.

Toys “R” Us bought the FAO Schwarz business in May 2009. Both companies had been struggling against discount retailers and web-based sellers like Amazon. Most acquisitions compromise the buyer’s robustness, and for an already weakened company like Toys “R” Us, the probability of success is even lower. Unsurprisingly, it closed Manhattan’s iconic FAO Schwarz store in July 2015.22 And left me distraught.
Dear Amazon, you have opened physical book shops in Manhattan. Time for toys?
Chapter Summary
Evolutionary theory has taught me that . . .
. . . we can reimagine investing by owning only robust businesses that are resilient to internal and external shocks, while continuing to evolve and grow.
1. There is a paradox in the living world: Organic life is highly complex but not fragile. Organisms have survived hundreds of millions of years despite living in constantly changing external environments and undergoing a barrage of internal mutations. This is because they are robust at multiple levels.
2. Thus, an accidental change in DNA sequence does not affect which amino acids are made; a change in amino acids or their sequence does not impact the synthesis of proteins; and a change in proteins need not affect the body plan of an organism.
3. Neutral mutations permit new functions and adaptations to arise without disrupting current functioning.
4. We want our businesses to mimic the robustness of the living world: to survive and prosper in a dynamic external environment, withstand internal strategic and organizational upheavals, and evolve by taking calculated risks.
5. Hence, we choose to invest only in businesses that are robust at multiple levels. A robust business has high ROCE, minimal or zero debt, a strong competitive advantage, fragmented customer and supplier bases, a stable management team, and is in a slow-changing industry.
6. Just because a business is robust today does not mean it will continue to be so. Our only protection against the loss of robustness of a business is to be price sensitive. We do not invest unless the market offers us an attractive valuation, which happens rarely.</div>
            <div class="text-block simplified-text">好的，这是根据您要求翻译的段落：

1988年，《华尔街日报》曾大胆预测：“街区大孩子玩具反斗城，增长不会停止。”仿佛应验预言一般，问题随之而来。1988年，沃尔玛以17.4%的市场份额略微领先于玩具反斗城的16.8%。在稳坐行业龙头十五年后，玩具反斗城跌落至第二位。它正遭受两头挤压：一头是沃尔玛、塔吉特和好市多等以低价竞争的折扣连锁店，另一头则是像Zany Brainy、Noodle Kidoodle和Imaginarium这样提供高价专业玩具和更优质服务的所谓寓教于乐公司。

1998年，公司推出了网站ToysRUs.com及其第一份邮购目录。但公司经营举步维艰，1998年成了“重组”之年——这通常是企业终止其科学项目及亏损计划的委婉说法。公司宣布大幅削减库存；关闭位于美国、法国和德国的59家门店；关闭39家儿童反斗城（Kids “R” Us）门店；并裁减三千名员工。重组成本如此之高，导致公司自上市以来首次宣布净亏损。

陷入困境的企业常常试图花钱摆脱危机。玩具反斗城也不例外。它在1998年收购了Imaginarium玩具中心。公司还频繁更换管理层——1994年至2000年间共经历了三任CEO。但它的下滑趋势仍在继续，亚马逊也强势进军玩具领域。1997年至2004年间，公司销售额停滞在110亿美元，营业利润则下降了约65%。营运资本回报率（ROCE）在1997年为15%，到2004年跌至4%。情况如此糟糕，以至于公司宣布可能完全退出玩具业务并专注于婴儿反斗城（Babies “R” Us）连锁店，震惊了世界。

好吧，让我们在此暂停，总结一下2005年的情况。

从1950年代末到1990年代末的近四十年里，玩具反斗城取得了惊人的成功。然而到了2000年代中期，它增长停滞，市场份额下降，盈利能力遭受重创。无论其困境的原因是什么，毫无疑问它已深陷危机。公司的稳健性受到了严重损害。也许是运气不佳，也许是管理失误，或者两者兼而有之。

思考这种局面的一种方式，是想象一位精英马拉松选手最近几个月表现下滑。他们曾经是健康与活力的典范，但如今看起来疲惫不堪，甚至无法以原先跑马拉松的配速跑完十公里。现在他们站在波士顿马拉松的起跑线上。你会期望他们的教练在比赛开始前做什么？如果我是教练，我会建议他们退出比赛，休息恢复几个月，慢慢增加跑量。也许你的建议会不同——你可能会建议他们放轻松，完成比赛即可，不必担心站上领奖台，以尽量减少对身体的伤害。如果我告诉你，教练不仅要求他们全速奔跑，还在他们背上加了一个十磅重的袋子，想必你会震惊不已！

然而这正是玩具反斗城的遭遇。2005年，私募股权巨头KKR、贝恩资本（Bain）以及房地产公司沃那多（Vornado）以66亿美元收购了玩具反斗城。然而，它们的股本出资仅为13亿美元，为此收购借款了53亿美元。然后，它们竟将这笔借款转嫁到玩具反斗城身上！如果你对杠杆收购（LBO）行业一无所知，可能会难以置信地揉揉眼睛。私募股权人士花巨资买下玩具反斗城，其中80%是借来的钱，然后让公司背上这笔债务来为他们的收购买单？哦，没错。欢迎来到奇妙的金融世界。

虽然从公司财务角度看，杠杆可能是有益的，但在我看来并非如此。但我希望各方都能同意，这对一家陷入困境的企业来说是灾难性的。这位精英但病弱的玩具反斗城“马拉松选手”，刚刚被要求背负十磅重物，与世界级选手同场竞技波士顿马拉松。请记住，资本主义世界是一场永无止境的波士顿马拉松——没有一场艰苦的两小时比赛结束后的喘息。比赛无休无止：一周7天、一天24小时、一年365天，永不间断，冷酷无情。

巨额债务负担意味着，到2007年，公司97%的营业利润都被利息支付吞噬了。哪里还有资金用于创新、投资门店、广告宣传、招聘和培训顶尖人才，以及做任何企业为保持领先所必需的事情？在《大西洋月刊》一篇关于玩具反斗城失败的文章中，一位受访者评论说公司被束缚了手脚，无法进行投资。另一位则正确指出：“他们确实无法应对亚马逊。但你必须问问为什么会这样。”乔治城大学麦克多诺商学院金融学教授凯瑟琳·沃尔德克在《华尔街日报》的一篇文章中表示：“每年4亿美元的偿债支出，在它们试图竞争时确实极具束缚性。”

玩具反斗城在多个层面本已不够稳健，其私募股权所有者施加的额外杠杆最终成了压垮骆驼的最后一根稻草。公司于2017年9月申请破产，CEO戴维·布兰登坦率承认：“公司过度杠杆化的资本结构限制了其进行必要的运营和资本支出，包括投资于门店的振兴。结果，公司在多个方面落后于其主要竞争对手。”这还用说。

玩具反斗城于2009年5月收购了FAO Schwarz业务。两家公司当时都在与折扣零售商和亚马逊等网络卖家苦苦抗争。大多数收购都会损害收购方的稳健性，对于像玩具反斗城这样已经虚弱的公司，成功的概率就更低了。不出所料，它于2015年7月关闭了位于曼哈顿的标志性FAO Schwarz门店。这让我心碎不已。

亲爱的亚马逊，你已经在曼哈顿开了实体书店。是时候开玩具店了吗？

**章节总结**
进化论教会我……
……我们可以重新构想投资，即只持有那些能够抵御内外冲击、同时持续进化成长的稳健企业。
1.  生物界存在一个悖论：有机生命高度复杂却并不脆弱。尽管生活在不断变化的外部环境中并经历一连串的内部突变，生物体仍存活了数亿年。这是因为它们在多个层面都具有稳健性。
2.  因此，DNA序列的偶然变化不会影响生成何种氨基酸；氨基酸或其序列的变化不会影响蛋白质的合成；蛋白质的变化也未必影响生物体的身体结构。
3.  中性突变允许新功能和适应性出现，而不干扰现有功能。
4.  我们希望企业能效仿生物世界的稳健性：在动态的外部环境中生存和繁荣，承受内部的战略和组织剧变，并通过承担经过计算的风险来进化。
5.  因此，我们选择仅投资于在多个层面都稳健的企业。一家稳健的企业应具备高ROCE、极少或零债务、强大的竞争优势、分散的客户和供应商基础、稳定的管理团队，并身处一个变化缓慢的行业。
6.  一家企业今天稳健，并不意味着它会一直如此。我们防范企业丧失稳健性的唯一方法是保持对价格敏感。除非市场提供具有吸引力的估值（这很少发生），否则我们不会投资。</div>
